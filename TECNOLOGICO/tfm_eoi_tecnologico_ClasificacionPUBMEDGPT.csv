While childhood TB contributes 10% to the global TB burden, the paucibacillary nature of TB disease in children and the absence of reliable diagnostic methods have made MTB diagnosis in children to be a great challenge. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MTB and rifampicin-resistant MTB (RR-MTB) among children using Gene Xpert MTB/RIF Assay in Tigray, Ethiopia.
A retrospective database study was conducted among children in ten governmental hospitals in the Tigray region. Gene Xpert MTB/RIF results of sputum/gastric lavage samples from children with presumptive TB from January 2016 to December 2019 were extracted using a data extraction sheet. Data were collected and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21.
The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed MTB by Gene-Xpert in children with presumptive TB was 7.3% (95% CI: 6.7%-7.9%) and the proportion of those that were Gene-Xpert MTB positive who also have rifampicin resistance was 10.9% (95% CI: 8.2-13.6%). Older children aged 11-15 years [AOR = 1.76; 95% CI = 1.33-2.33, p < 0.001] and adolescents 16-17 years [AOR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.63-2.92, p < 0.001] were more likely to be MTB positive. Relapse cases [AOR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.09-2.51, p = 0.017] and lost/failure cases [AOR = 8.82; 95% CI = 3.94-19.76, p < 0.001] were more likely to have MTB compared to the new cases.
The proportion of MTB-positive among the TB presumptive patients was 7.3%. The proportion of rifampicin-resistant TB to all positive patients was 10.9%.

The role of ATG5 beyond Atg8ylation and autophagy.,[],Autophagy,"ATG5 plays a pivotal role in membrane Atg8ylation, influencing downstream processes encompassing canonical autophagy and noncanonical processes. Remarkably, genetic ablation of ATG5 in myeloid cells leads to an exacerbated pathological state in murine models of tuberculosis, characterized by an early surge in mortality much more severe when compared to the depletion of other components involved in Atg8ylation or canonical autophagy. This study shows that in the absence of ATG5, but not other core canonical autophagy factors, endolysosomal organelles display a lysosomal hypersensitivity phenotype when subjected to damage. This is in part due to a compromised recruitment of ESCRT proteins to lysosomes in need of repair. Mechanistically, in the absence of ATG5, the ESCRT protein PDCD6IP/ALIX is sequestered by the alternative conjugate ATG12-ATG3, contributing to excessive exocytic processes while not being available for lysosomal repair. Specifically, this condition increases secretion of extracellular vesicles and particles, and leads to excessive degranulation in neutrophils. Our findings uncover unique functions of ATG5 outside of the autophagy and Atg8ylation paradigm. This finding is of in vivo relevance for tuberculosis pathogenesis as modeled in mice.",2023-10-25,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Fulong', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Trosdal', 'firstname': 'Einar S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Paddar', 'firstname': 'Masroor Ahmad', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duque', 'firstname': 'Thabata L A', 'initials': 'TLA', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Allers', 'firstname': 'Lee', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mudd', 'firstname': 'Michal', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Akepati', 'firstname': 'Prithvi R', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Javed', 'firstname': 'Ruheena', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jia', 'firstname': 'Jingyue', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Salemi', 'firstname': 'Michelle', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Proteomics Core Facility, UC Davis Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Phinney', 'firstname': 'Brett', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Proteomics Core Facility, UC Davis Genome Center, University of California, Davis, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Deretic', 'firstname': 'Vojo', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center of Biochemical Research Excellence.\nDepartment of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, USA.\nLeadContact.'}]",Enfermedad: tuberculosis.

Global-scale GWAS associates a subset of SNPs with animal-adapted variants in M. tuberculosis complex.,[],BMC medical genomics,"While Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) variants are clonal, variant tuberculosis is a human-adapted pathogen, and variant bovis infects many hosts. Despite nucleotide identity between MTBC variants exceeding 99.95%, it remains unclear what drives these differences. Markers of adaptation into variants were sought by bacterial genome-wide association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms extracted from 6,362 MTBC members from varied hosts and countries.
The search identified 120 genetic loci associated with MTBC variant classification and certain hosts. In many cases, these changes are uniformly fixed in certain variants while absent in others in this dataset, providing good discriminatory power in distinguishing variants by polymorphisms. Multiple changes were seen in genes for cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, pathways previously proposed to be important for host adaptation, including Mce4F (part of the fundamental cholesterol intake Mce4 pathway), 4 FadD and FadE genes (playing roles in cholesterol and fatty acid utilization), and other targets like Rv3548c and PTPB, genes shown essential for growth on cholesterol by transposon studies.
These findings provide a robust set of genetic loci associated with the split of variant bovis and variant tuberculosis, and suggest that adaptation to new hosts could involve adjustments in uptake and catabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids, like the proposed specialization to different populations in MTB lineages by alterations to host lipid composition. Future studies are required to elucidate how the associations between cholesterol profiles and pathogen utilization differences between hosts and MTBC variants, as well as the investigation of uncharacterized genes discovered in this study.

Genotype-Phenotype Characterization of Serial Mycobacterium tuberculosis Isolates in Bedaquiline-Resistant Tuberculosis.,"['bedaquiline', 'drug resistance', 'tuberculosis', 'whole-genome sequencing']",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,"Emerging resistance to bedaquiline (BDQ) threatens to undermine advances in the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DRTB). Characterizing serial Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates collected during BDQ-based treatment can provide insights into the etiologies of BDQ resistance in this important group of DRTB patients.
We measured mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT)-based BDQ minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Mtb isolates collected from 195 individuals with no prior BDQ exposure who were receiving BDQ-based treatment for DRTB. We conducted whole-genome sequencing on serial Mtb isolates from all participants who had any isolate with a BDQ MIC >1 collected before or after starting treatment (95 total Mtb isolates from 24 participants).
Sixteen of 24 participants had BDQ-resistant TB (MGIT MIC ≥4 µg/mL) and 8 had BDQ-intermediate infections (MGIT MIC = 2 µg/mL). Participants with pre-existing resistance outnumbered those with resistance acquired during treatment, and 8 of 24 participants had polyclonal infections. BDQ resistance was observed across multiple Mtb strain types and involved a diverse catalog of mmpR5 (Rv0678) mutations, but no mutations in atpE or pepQ. Nine pairs of participants shared genetically similar isolates separated by <5 single nucleotide polymorphisms, concerning for potential transmitted BDQ resistance.
BDQ-resistant TB can arise via multiple, overlapping processes, including transmission of strains with pre-existing resistance.

Facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing in community and clinical settings: Lessons learned from Lesotho and Zambia.,[],PLOS global public health,"The sudden emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a devastating impact on health systems and population health globally. To combat the spread of COVID-19, countries enacted guidelines and safety measures, including testing, contact tracing, and quarantine. It was unclear the extent to which uptake of COVID-19 testing and other health initiatives would be accepted in countries with a history of dealing with widespread communicable disease transmission such as HIV or Tuberculosis. The objective of this study was to understand and compare the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing at hospital sites in two rural communities in Lesotho and community spaces (referred to as hubs) in one urban community in Zambia during active phases of COVID-19 pandemic. Individual interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were held during March-October 2021 to explore facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing. FGDs with 105 community members and health care workers, and 16 individual interviews with key informants and four mystery shoppers were conducted across the two countries. In Zambia, four mystery shopper observations, and eight hub observations were also conducted. Individual country codebooks were developed and combined; thematic analyses were then conducted using the combined codebook. Findings were compared across the two countries, and most were consistent across the two countries. Two primary themes emerged that related to both barriers and facilitators: (1) structural conditions; (2) social implications and attitudes. The structural conditions that operated as barriers in both countries included public health isolation measures and misinformation. In Lesotho, the cost of tests was an additional barrier. The only structural facilitators were in Zambia where the community hubs were found to be accessible and convenient. The social implication barriers related to fear of isolation, stigma, and mental health implications because of quarantine, perceived pain of the test, and compromised privacy. Social facilitators that led to people testing included experiencing COVID-19 firsthand and knowing people who had died because of COVID-19. Across both countries, primary barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 related to structural conditions and social implications and attitudes. Public health measures can be at odds with social and economic realities; pandemic response should balance public health control and the socio-economic needs. Data from Zambia revealed that community-based settings have the potential to increase uptake of testing services.

The cross-talk between leptin and circadian rhythm signaling proteins in physiological processes: a systematic review.,"['BMAL1', 'Circadian rhythm', 'Clock genes', 'Leptin', 'Metabolism', 'REV-ERBα']",Molecular biology reports,"Today, modern lifestyles and disrupted sleep patterns cause circadian clock rhythm impairments that are associated with altered leptin levels, which subsequently affect a wide range of physiological processes and have significant health burdens on societies. Nevertheless, there has been no systematic review of circadian clock genes and proteins, leptin, and related signaling pathways.
Accordingly, we systematically reviewed circadian clock proteins, leptin, and molecular mechanisms between them by searching Pubmed, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Sciences, and Google Scholar until September 2022. After considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 animal studies were selected. The risk of bias was assessed in each study.
The results clarified the reciprocal interconnected relationship between circadian clock genes and leptin. Circadian clock genes regulate leptin expression and signaling via different mechanisms, such as CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers, which increase the expression of PPARs. PPARs induce the expression of C/EBPα, a key factor in upregulating leptin expression. CLOCK-BMAL1 also induces the expression of Per1 and Rev-erb genes. PER1 activates mTORC1 and mTORC1 enhances the expression of C/EBPα. In addition, REV-ERBs activate the leptin signaling pathway. Also, leptin controls the expression of circadian clock genes by triggering the AMPK and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways, which regulate the activity of PPARs. Moreover, the roles of these molecular mechanisms are elucidated in different physiological processes and organs.
Crosstalk between circadian clock genes and leptin and their affecting elements should be considered in the selection of new therapeutic targets for related disorders, especially obesity and metabolic impairments.",2023-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Ansarin', 'firstname': 'Atefeh', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Pashmineh Research Complex, Daneshgah Street, P.O.

The first step is always represented by stopping all anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs, treating reaction with systemic corticosteroids, and identifying the offending drug, even if it is often complicated by the patient's simultaneous intake of antibiotics. Patch tests and in vitro tests, such as lymphocyte transformation test, could bridge this diagnostic gap, but the available data are scarce and their sensitivity low. The re-challenge test is often necessary but places patients at risk for serious adverse reactions. The desensitization protocols are quite varied and not universally accepted. In this narrative review, we provide an update to the literature data on the management of DRESS and DILI with particular attention to the allergological work-up in the last decade.",2023-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Rizzi', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'UOSD Allergologia e Immunologia Clinica, Dipartimento Scienze Mediche e Chirurgiche Addominali ed Endocrino Metaboliche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Novel six-month oral regimens that include bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa), linezolid (L) with or without a fourth drug, have been shown to be as or more effective than the established longer regimens for the treatment of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis/rifampicin resistant (MDR/RR-TB). We aimed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of linezolid in BPaL-containing regimens for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB among recently-completed clinical trials.
A review and meta-analysis was undertaken including published and unpublished data from clinical trials, conducted between 2010 and 2021, that evaluated regimens containing BPaL for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB. Individual patient data were obtained. For each BPaL-containing regimen, we evaluated the frequency and severity of treatment related adverse events. The risk difference of adverse events for each regimen was calculated, in comparison to patients assigned to receiving the lowest cumulative exposure of linezolid.
Data from three clinical trials investigating eight unique BPaL-containing regimens were included, comprising a total of 591 participants. Adverse events were more frequent in groups randomized to a higher cumulative linezolid dose. Among patients who were randomized to a daily dose of 1200mg of linezolid, 68/195 (35%) experienced a Grade 3-4 adverse event vs 89/396 (22%) of patients receiving BPaL-containing regimens containing 600mg of linezolid.
Regimens containing BPaL were relatively well-tolerated when they included a daily linezolid dose of 600mg.

Computational analysis was performed on the whole Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv proteome using a software program for the prediction of adhesin and adhesin-like proteins using neural networks (SPAAN) to determine the adhesin potential of CH proteins. A robust pipeline of computational analysis tools: Phyre2 and pFam for homology prediction; Mycosub, PsortB, and Loctree3 for subcellular localization; SignalP-5.0 and SecretomeP-2.0 for secretory prediction, were utilized to identify adhesin candidates.
SPAAN revealed 776 potential adhesins within the whole MTB H37Rv proteome. Comprehensive analysis of the literature was cross-tabulated with SPAAN to verify the adhesin prediction potential of known adhesin (

Approximately 450,000 people in the country develop tuberculosis (TB) disease every year, and 270,000 of those are HIV positive. This suggests that being HIV positive significantly increases one's susceptibility to TB, accelerating the spread of the epidemic. To better understand the disease burden at the population level, a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) TB-HIV co-infection epidemic model is presented.

Hence, the aim of this research was to explore the association of incidence of silicosis and other important risk factors with TB mortality and morbidity using multi-country data.
Data from 217 WHO region countries were utilized, sourcing TB-related statistics from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation and additional risk factors from the Demographic and Health Survey, Global Burden of Disease, and World Bank for 2019. Regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between silicosis incidence and TB outcomes.
The study found an average silicosis incidence of 121.92 per 100,000 population. Additionally, 62.69% of the sample population are exposed to air pollution from solid fuel cooking. Sanitation access stands at an average of 59.67%.

Various methods have been employed, each with strengths and weaknesses. This article addresses limitations in existing techniques and introduces two novel automated methods for BBQ within macrophages based on confocal microscopy data analysis. The first method refines total fluorescence quantification by incorporating filtering steps to exclude uninfected cells, while the second method calculates total bacterial volume per cell to mitigate potential biases in fluorescence-based readouts. These workflows utilize PyImageJ and Cellpose software, providing reliable, unbiased, and rapid quantification of bacterial load. The proposed workflows were validated using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Mycobacterium tuberculosis models, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately assessing bacterial burden.

Conference report: WHO meeting report on mRNA-based tuberculosis vaccine development.,[],Vaccine,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a global health emergency. Across the globe, approximately 2 billion people are currently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and of those, 5-10% may progress to become ill and potentially transmit the bacterium. In 2021, nearly 10.6 million people developed TB disease and 1.6 million died. There is an urgent need for accelerated development of new TB-focused interventions, in particular, improved TB vaccines. However, progress in developing highly effective TB vaccines has been slow and is chronically under-resourced. The mRNA vaccine platform may offer an opportunity to accelerate development of new TB vaccines. In April 2023, the World Health Organization convened global experts to discuss the feasibility and potential value of mRNA-based vaccines for TB. Here we report on meeting deliberations related to the current TB vaccine pipeline and potential novel antigens, the status of efforts to identify correlates of protection, potential clinical development strategies and considerations for community acceptance of new TB vaccines based on this relatively new platform. The role of industry collaborations, ethics, social science, and responsibility to the global community regarding transparency and manufacturing capacity building were discussed through expert presentations and panel sessions.

Intrabacterial lipid inclusion-associated proteins: A core machinery conserved from saprophyte Actinobacteria to the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"['bacterial lipid droplets', 'lipid metabolism', 'pathogenesis', 'triacylglycerol']",FEBS open bio,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the aetiologic agent of tuberculosis (TB), stores triacylglycerol (TAG) in the form of intrabacterial lipid inclusions (ILI) to survive and chronically persist within its host. These highly energetic molecules represent a major source of carbon to support bacterial persistence and reactivation, thus playing a leading role in TB pathogenesis. However, despite its physiological and clinical relevance, ILI metabolism in Mtb remains poorly understood. Recent discoveries have suggested that several ILI-associated proteins might be widely conserved across TAG-producing prokaryotes, but still very little is known regarding the nature and the biological functions of these proteins. Herein, we performed an in silico analysis of three independent ILI-associated proteomes previously reported to computationally define a potential core ILI-associated proteome, referred to as ILIome. Our investigation revealed the presence of 70 orthologous proteins that were strictly conserved, thereby defining a minimal ILIome core. We further narrowed our analysis to proteins involved in lipid metabolism and discuss here their putative biological functions, along with their molecular interactions and dynamics at the surface of these bacterial organelles. We also highlight the experimental limitations of the original proteomic investigations and of the present bioinformatic analysis, while describing new technological approaches and presenting biological perspectives in the field. The in silico investigation presented here aims at providing useful datasets that could constitute a scientific resource of broad interest for the mycobacterial community, with the ultimate goal of enlightening ILI metabolism in prokaryotes with a special emphasis on Mtb pathogenesis.",2023-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Dargham', 'firstname': 'Tonia', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LISM UMR 7255, IMM FR3479, IM2B, Marseille, France.\nIHU Méditerranée Infection, Aix-Marseille Univ., Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Mallick', 'firstname': 'Ivy', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LISM UMR 7255, IMM FR3479, IM2B, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kremer', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR 9004, Institut de Recherche en Infectiologie de Montpellier (IRIM), Université de Montpellier, 34293, Montpellier, France.\nINSERM, Institut de Recherche en Infectiologie de Montpellier, 34293, Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Santucci', 'firstname': 'Pierre', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LISM UMR 7255, IMM FR3479, IM2B, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Canaan', 'firstname': 'Stéphane', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LISM UMR 7255, IMM FR3479, IM2B, Marseille, France.'}]",Tuberculosis (TB)

The success rates in the treatment of tuberculosis are suboptimal. Objective. To identify associated factors with the lack of success of antituberculosis treatment in patients with a tuberculosis treatment history. Materials and methods. We performed a retrospective, analytical, observational, and cohort study of patients reentering the Mycobacterium program in Cali, Colombia. We included patients over 15 years old with pulmonary tuberculosis between 2015 and 2019 and a history of tuberculosis treatment. Patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis were excluded. Results. A total of 605 patients with a treatment history were included, 60% due to unfinished treatment and 40% due to relapse. Compared to patients reentering due to relapse (ORa=2.34, CI=1.62-3.38), the independent variables associated with treatment failure at discharge were homelessness (ORa=2.45, CI=1.54-3.89), substance dependence (ORa=1.95, CI=1.24-3.05), tuberculosis/HIV coinfection (ORa=1.69, CI=1.00-2.86), diabetes (ORa=1.89, CI=1.29-2.77), and unfinished previous tuberculosis treatment due to follow-up loss, abandonment, or other causes. Programmatic variables favoring treatment success were voluntary HIV testing counseling (p<0.001) and HIV testing (p<0.001). Conclusion. Homelessness, substance dependence, tuberculosis/HIV coinfection, diabetes, and incomplete previous treatment due to loss to follow-up, abandonment, or treatment failure hindered the success of antituberculosis. These characteristics should be identified and addressed during the initial care of patients reentering treatment for tuberculosis.
Introducción. Las tasas de éxito del tratamiento de la tuberculosis continúan siendo subóptimas. Objetivo. Identificar los factores asociados al tratamiento no exitoso para tuberculosis en pacientes con antecedentes de tratamiento para la tuberculosis. Materiales y métodos. Se realizó un estudio observacional retrospectivo, analítico, de cohorte de pacientes que reingresaron a un programa de micobacterias en Cali, Colombia. Se incluyeron mayores de 15 años con tuberculosis pulmonar entre el 2015 y el 2019 con antecedentes de tratamiento para la tuberculosis. Se excluyeron los pacientes con tuberculosis resistente. Resultados. Ingresaron 605 pacientes con antecedentes de tratamiento, 60 % por tratamiento inconcluso y 40 % por recaída. En comparación con los pacientes que reingresaron por recaída (ORa= 2,34; IC=1,62-3,38), las variables que explicaron de manera independiente el no tener éxito con el tratamiento para la tuberculosis al egreso fueron: estar en situación de calle (ORa = 2,45; IC = 1,54-3,89), ser farmacodependiente (ORa = 1,95; IC=1,24-3,05), tener coinfección tuberculosis/VIH (ORa = 1,69; IC =1,00-2,86) o diabetes (ORa =1,89; IC=1,29-2,77), y el incumplimiento de un tratamiento previo por pérdida de seguimiento, abandono u otras causas. Las variables programáticas que favorecieron el éxito del tratamiento fueron la asesoría de la prueba voluntaria de VIH (p <0,001) y la realización de la prueba de VIH (p < 0,001). Conclusión. Estar en situación de calle, ser farmacodependiente, tener coinfección de tuberculosis y VIH, o diabetes, así como el incumplimiento del tratamiento previo por pérdida del seguimiento, abandono o fracaso del mismo, dificultaron el éxito del tratamiento antituberculoso.

Inhibition of this enzyme has been featured as an efficient strategy for the development of new antimycobacterial agents against drug-resistant pathogens. In this study, we synthesised and explored two distinct series of squaric acid analogues designed to inhibit mycobacterial ATP synthase. Among the extensive array of compounds investigated, members of the phenyl-substituted sub-library emerged as primary hits. To gain deeper insights into their mechanisms of action, we conducted advanced biological studies, focusing on the compounds displaying a direct binding of a nitrogen heteroatom to the phenyl ring, resulting in the highest potency. Our investigations into spontaneous mutants led to the validation of a single point mutation within the atpB gene (Rv1304), responsible for encoding the ATP synthase subunit a. This genetic alteration sheds light on the molecular basis of resistance to squaramides. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of synergy between squaramides and the reference drug clofazimine using a checkerboard assay, highlighting the promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of existing treatments through combined therapeutic approaches.

G9a and Sirtuin6 epigenetically modulate host cholesterol accumulation to facilitate mycobacterial survival.,[],PLoS pathogens,"Cholesterol derived from the host milieu forms a critical factor for mycobacterial pathogenesis. However, the molecular circuitry co-opted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to accumulate cholesterol in host cells remains obscure. Here, we report that the coordinated action of WNT-responsive histone modifiers G9a (H3K9 methyltransferase) and SIRT6 (H3K9 deacetylase) orchestrate cholesterol build-up in in vitro and in vivo mouse models of Mtb infection. Mechanistically, G9a, along with SREBP2, drives the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake genes; while SIRT6 along with G9a represses the genes involved in cholesterol efflux. The accumulated cholesterol in Mtb infected macrophages promotes the expression of antioxidant genes leading to reduced oxidative stress, thereby supporting Mtb survival.

Rural-Urban Inequities in Tuberculosis-Related Practices in Equatorial Guinea.,"['Health-seeking behaviour', 'Practices', 'Treatment abandon', 'Tuberculosis']",Journal of epidemiology and global health,"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading causes of mortality from a single infectious disease agent. Equatorial Guinea is a country with high estimated TB incidence in 2021 (275 cases per 100,000 population) and low TB case detection (42%). Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for TB control. Failure to seek adequate health care increases the disease's transmission and leads to poor treatment outcome, the mortality, even for easily manageable conditions. Information regarding community management of TB and treatment-seeking patterns in Equatorial Guinea is rare. The aim of this study was to explore differences in TB health-seeking behaviour among urban and rural population TB cases in Equatorial Guinea and the factors associated with this behaviour.
A national cross-sectional study of 770 household caregivers was conducted in 2020 in Equatorial Guinea using multistage stratified sampling. The 284 caregivers that reported having had a TB case in their family were included in this study. A practice index was created. Poisson regression with robust variance was performed with the practices index as dependent variable to assess the factors associated with the health-seeking behaviour.
Most of the cases (65%) have had good TB health-seeking practices. However, 23.2% of TB cases reported having abandoned treatment before 6 months. A higher probability of having good TB practices was observed with being women, aged and living in rural area. Those who were TB cases themselves have heard about TB on the radio, and had high knowledge about TB, hand also good practices.
Disparities in tuberculosis health-seeking behaviour between rural and urban populations highlight the challenges existing in the fight against this infectious disease. The National Tuberculosis Control Program has to reinforce the health system needs to strengthen the follow-up of TB patients taking into account the population at risk of inappropriate TB behaviour.

Immune Features of Tumor Microenvironment: A Genetic Spotlight.,"['CTLA-4', 'Cancer', 'TP53', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,"A tumor represents a highly intricate tissue entity, characterized by an exceptionally complex microenvironment that starkly contrasts with the typical physiological surroundings of healthy tissues. Within this tumor microenvironment (TME), every component and factor assume paramount importance in the progression of malignancy and exerts a pivotal influence on a patient's clinical outcome. One of the remarkable aspects of the TME is its remarkable heterogeneity, not only across different types of cancers but even within the same histological category of tumors. In-depth research has illuminated the intricate interplay between specific immune cells and molecules and the dynamic characteristics of the TME. Recent investigations have yielded compelling evidence that several mutations harbored by tumor cells possess the capacity to instigate substantial alterations in the TME. These mutations, often acting as drivers of tumorigenesis, can orchestrate a cascade of events that remodel the TME, thereby influencing crucial aspects of cancer behavior, including its invasiveness, immune evasion, and response to therapies. It is within this nuanced context that the present study endeavors to provide a concise yet comprehensive summary of how specific mutations, within the genetic landscape of cancer cells, can instigate profound changes in TME features. By elucidating the intricate relationship between genetic mutations and the TME, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of cancer biology. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this study holds the potential to inform the development of more targeted and effective treatments, thereby offering new hope to patients grappling with the complexities of cancer.",2023-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Asadi', 'firstname': 'Milad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Oncology, Health Institute of Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Zarredar', 'firstname': 'Habib', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Zafari', 'firstname': 'Venus', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Oncology, Health Institute of Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Soleimani', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Tuberculosis and Lung Disease Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Saeedi', 'firstname': 'Hossein', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Caner', 'firstname': 'Ayse', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Oncology, Health Institute of Ege University, Izmir, Turkey. ayse.caner@ege.edu.tr.\nThe University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA. ayse.caner@ege.edu.tr.'}, {'lastname': 'Shanehbandi', 'firstname': 'Dariush', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. dariush_shanehbandi@yahoo.com.\nCancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Research Center, Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, Ardabil, Iran. dariush_shanehbandi@yahoo.com.'}]",NO_IDENTIFICADO

Statistics is not often used as a tool to assist in such diagnoses, and therefore this study aimed at employing data mining and machine learning in the form of decision tree analysis to aid in recognizing tuberculosis (TB) in skeletal remains and find patterns of skeletal involvement. The sample included 387 modern South African individuals (n = 207 individuals known to have died of TB and n = 180 as a control group) which were scored for the presence or absence of 21 skeletal lesions documented to be associated with TB. A pruned decision tree classification analysis was done to detect significant patterns and associations between variables which produced a model with a moderate classification rate based on four of the variables. As expected, vertebral changes were selected first, followed by rib, acetabular and lastly cranial changes. As a proof of concept, it was shown that machine learning was able to identify patterns of changes in TB skeletons versus a control group.

High prevalence of current tobacco smoking among patients with tuberculosis and people living with HIV in Jordan: A cross-sectional survey.,"['PLHIV', 'migration health', 'socioeconomic status', 'tobacco use', 'tuberculosis']",Tobacco induced diseases,"Continued smoking by patients with tuberculosis (TB) and people living with HIV (PLHIV) leads to adverse treatment outcomes. Estimates of tobacco use among the population are scarce in the Eastern Mediterranean region, where the burden of TB and HIV is also low but highly variable. This study determined the prevalence of current smoking and assessed factors associated with current smoking among patients with TB and PLHIV in Jordan.
We analyzed data from the Jordan Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices survey in 2021. Information on current tobacco use, including products and frequency of smoking, was collected from 452 patients with TB and 152 PLHIV. We performed multivariable logistic regression to assess the sociodemographic characteristics independently associated with current smoking.
Prevalence of current smoking was 43.8% among TB patients and 67.8 % among PLHIV, and conventional cigarettes were the most used tobacco products. The prevalence of current smoking among patients with TB was higher among males (AOR=8.20; 95% CI: 5.05-13.32), Jordanians (AOR=5.37; 95% CI: 2.66-10.86) and Syrians (AOR=4.13; 95% CI: 1.60-10.67), and those experiencing financial difficulties (AOR=2.83; 95% CI: 1.69-4.74). The prevalence of current smoking among PLHIV was higher in those with financial difficulties (AOR=3.13; 95% CI: 1.19-8.27).

The Challenges of Diagnosing Tuberculous Meningitis and Importance of Early Intervention.,"['Meningitis', 'Tuberculosis', 'Tuberculous meningitis']",Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,"Reported is a patient found to have miliary TB seeding the lungs and brain with CNS involvement resulting in tuberculous meningitis (TBM). False security in laboratory studies that lack adequate sensitivity resulted in delay of therapy which may have negatively impacted the patient's outcome. This case report aims to emphasize the importance of early initiation of therapy when clinical suspicion remains high despite initially negative diagnostic studies.
52 year old female originally from Guatemala presented headache, neck pain, vomiting and photophobia. CT of the chest showed numerous submillimeter sized bilateral lung nodules, with scattered calcifications. IGRA of the serum, sputum Acid Fast Bacillus (AFB) stain and culture and CSF AFB stain and culture were obtained and were all initially negative. Clinical suspicion for tuberculous meningitis remained high and RIPE therapy and methylprednisolone were started. CSF AFB culture was found positive for MTB. Despite therapy, patient continued to clinically decline with poor overall prognosis.
Early diagnosis and initiation of therapy is paramount in improving outcomes in TBM. Unfortunately, the available diagnostic tests lack adequate sensitivity to confidently rule out disease. False negative results can delay therapy and worsen clinical outcomes. Early identification often relies on history, evaluation of risk factors, in conjunction with corresponding labs and imaging findings. If clinical suspicion is high, empiric therapy should be initiated early.

Large scale spatio-temporal modelling of risk factors associated with tuberculosis exposure at the wildlife-livestock interface.,"['Bovine tuberculosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Regionalization', 'Risk factors', 'Variation partitioning', 'Wildlife-livestock interface']",Preventive veterinary medicine,"The management of animal tuberculosis (TB) is a priority for European Union animal health authorities. However, and despite all the efforts made to date, a significant part of Spain has as yet been unable to obtain the officially tuberculosis-free (OTF) status. Information regarding wildlife disease status is usually scarce, signifying that the role played by wildlife is usually ignored or poorly assessed in large-scale TB risk factor studies. The National Wildlife Health Surveillance Plan in Spain now provides information on infection rates in wildlife reservoirs at a national level, but there are limitations as regards the sample size, the spatio-temporal distribution of the samples, and the lack of homogeneity of the diagnostic techniques employed. The objective of the study described herein was, therefore, to employ a Bayesian approach with the intention of identifying the risk factors associated with four TB rates in cattle: prevalence, incidence, maintenance and persistence in Spain during the period 2014-2019. The modeling approach included highly informative spatio-temporal latent effects with which to control the limitations of the data. Variation partitioning procedures were carried out, and the pure effect of each factor was mapped in order to identify the most relevant factors associated with TB dynamics in cattle in each region. This made it possible to disclose that the movement of cattle, particularly from counties with herd incidence > 1%, was the main driver of the TB dynamics in cattle. The abundance of herds bred for bullfighting was retained in all four models, but had less weight than the movements. After accounting for farm-related factors, the TB prevalence in wild boar was retained in all the models and was significantly related to incidence, maintenance and persistence. With regard to the incidence, variation partitioning revealed that wildlife was the most explicative factor, thus suggesting that it plays a role in the introduction of the pathogen into uninfected herds, and consequently highlighting its importance in breakdowns. These results show, for the first time on a national scale, that wild ungulates play a relevant role in the spatio-temporal variability of TB in cattle, particularly as regards their disease status. Moreover, the spatial representation of the pure effect of each factor made it possible to identify which factors are driving the disease dynamics in each region, thus showing that it is a valuable tool with which to focus efforts towards achieving the OTF status.",2023-10-23,"[{'lastname': 'Herraiz', 'firstname': 'Cesar', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Health and Biotechnology Research Group (SaBio), Institute for Game and Wildlife Research (IREC), CSIC-JCCM-UCLM, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Vicente', 'firstname': 'Joaquín', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Health and Biotechnology Research Group (SaBio), Institute for Game and Wildlife Research (IREC), CSIC-JCCM-UCLM, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gortázar', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Health and Biotechnology Research Group (SaBio), Institute for Game and Wildlife Research (IREC), CSIC-JCCM-UCLM, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Acevedo', 'firstname': 'Pelayo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Health and Biotechnology Research Group (SaBio), Institute for Game and Wildlife Research (IREC), CSIC-JCCM-UCLM, 13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.

Analytical reference framework to analyze non-COVID-19 events.,"['Forecasting models', 'No COVID-19 events', 'SARIMA', 'Suicide attempt', 'Tuberculosis']",Population health metrics,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the healthcare system, leading to delays in detection of other non-COVID-19 diseases. This paper presents ANE Framework (Analytics for Non-COVID-19 Events), a reliable and user-friendly analytical forecasting framework designed to predict the number of patients with non-COVID-19 diseases. Prior to 2020, there were analytical models focused on specific illnesses and contexts. Then, most models have focused on understanding COVID-19 behavior. There is a lack of analytical frameworks that enable disease forecasting for non-COVID-19 diseases.
The ANE Framework utilizes time series analysis to generate forecasting models. The framework leverages daily data from official government sources and employs SARIMA models to forecast the number of non-COVID-19 cases, such as tuberculosis and suicide attempts.
The framework was tested on five different non-COVID-19 events. The framework performs well across all events, including tuberculosis and suicide attempts, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of up to 20% and the consistency remains independent of the behavior of each event. Moreover, a pairwise comparison of averages can lead to over or underestimation of the impact. The disruption caused by the pandemic resulted in a 17% gap (2383 cases) between expected and reported tuberculosis cases, and a 19% gap (2464 cases) for suicide attempts. These gaps varied between 20 and 64% across different cities and regions. The ANE Framework has proven to be reliable for analyzing several diseases and exhibits the flexibility to incorporate new data from various sources. Regular updates and the inclusion of new associated data enhance the framework's effectiveness.
Current pandemic shows the necessity of developing flexible models to be adapted to different illness data.

One of the most important steps in the pathogenesis of this disease and granuloma formation is the phagocytosis of tuberculous bacilli by macrophages. Mycobacteria replicate in macrophages, which are crucial to the pathophysiology of mycobacterial infections; however, scarce information is available about the dynamics of the granuloma-stage immunological response. Therefore, immunohistochemistry was used in this work to evaluate the expression of CD68, iNOS, and HLA-DR in different stages of TB granulomas from naturally infected cattle with tuberculosis. Two thousand, one hundred and fifty slaughtered beef cattle were examined during the period from September 2020 to March 2022. Sixty of them showed gross tuberculous pulmonary lesions and samples were collected from all of them for histopathological examination, Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, and bacteriological culturing.

Integrated analysis of microbiome and host transcriptome reveals the damage/protective mechanism of corn oil and olive oil on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu).,"['Corn oil', 'Fish oil', 'Gut', 'Microbiome', 'Olive oil', 'Transcriptome']",International journal of biological macromolecules,"As digestive and immune organs of animals, the gut was frequently used to evaluate the health status of aquatic animals. In previous oil source alternatives study, corn oil (CO) had been found to induce gut inflammation, while olive oil (OO) had been found to be effective in protecting intestinal health. Three diets with different oil sources (fish oil, CO, OO) were formulated for an 8-week culture experiment, and it was proposed to combine 16S sequencing and transcriptome sequencing analysis to preliminarily elucidate the damage/protection mechanism of CO and OO on the gut health of grouper (♀ Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × ♂ E. lanceolatu). We found that CO indeed damaged to gut health and destroyed the gut structure, while OO had a positive outcome in protecting the gut structure, promoting digestibility and relieving enteritis. Photobacterium, Romboutsia and Epulopiscium were significantly enriched in OO group and Staphylococcus were significantly enriched in CO group. Transcriptome sequencing further revealed CO could activated Complement and coagulation cascades, Staphylococcus aureus infection, Systemic lupus erythematosus, and Tuberculosis pathways; conversely, OO activated B-cell signaling receptors, promoted B-cell proliferation and apoptosis, and thus activated B-cell signaling pathways to enhance immunity, whereas OO can regulate IL17 signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway to inhibit NF-κB signaling pathway to reduce pro-inflammatory response. By integrating the microbiome and transcriptome, further identified all differential microorganisms were directly and significantly correlated with differential genes, and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia, Staphylococcus might as the core regulates the expression of differential gene in the organism.

The heparin-binding haemagglutinin protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a nucleoid-associated protein.,"['DNA damage', 'DNA topology', 'DNA transcription', 'DNA-protein interaction', 'Genome organization', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs)']",The Journal of biological chemistry,"Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) regulate multiple cellular processes such as gene expression, virulence, and dormancy throughout bacterial species. NAPs help in the survival and adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) within the host. Fourteen NAPs have been identified in Escherichia coli (E. coli); however, only seven NAPs are documented in Mtb. Given its complex lifestyle, it is reasonable to assume that Mtb would encode for more NAPs. Using bioinformatics tools and biochemical experiments, we have identified the heparin-binding haemagglutinin (HbhA) protein of Mtb as a novel sequence-independent DNA-binding protein which has previously been characterised as an adhesion molecule required for extra-pulmonary dissemination. Deleting the carboxy-terminal domain of HbhA resulted in a complete loss of its DNA-binding activity. Atomic force microscopy showed HbhA-mediated architectural modulations in the DNA, which may play a regulatory role in transcription and genome organisation. Our results showed that HbhA colocalizes with the nucleoid region of Mtb. Transcriptomics analyses of a hbhA knockout strain revealed that it regulates the expression of ∼36% of total and ∼29% of essential genes. Deletion of hbhA resulted in the upregulation of ∼73% of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs), belonging to multiple pathways suggesting it to be a global repressor. The results show that HbhA is a non-essential NAP regulating gene expression globally and acting as a plausible transcriptional repressor.",2023-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Keshavam', 'firstname': 'Chetkar Chandra', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Naz', 'firstname': 'Saba', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India; CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Aanchal', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanyal', 'firstname': 'Priyadarshini', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India; Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR- Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB) Campus, Hyderabad.'}, {'lastname': 'Kochar', 'firstname': 'Manisha', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India; CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gangwal', 'firstname': 'Aakriti', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sangwan', 'firstname': 'Nitika', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Nishant', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Tyagi', 'firstname': 'Ekta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Goel', 'firstname': 'Simran', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Nitesh Kumar', 'initials': 'NK', 'affiliation': 'CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sowpati', 'firstname': 'Divya Tej', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Khare', 'firstname': 'Garima', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi 110021, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ganguli', 'firstname': 'Munia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Raze', 'firstname': 'Dominique', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Univ.

In lung-on-chip (LoC) and mouse models, cords in alveolar cells contribute to suppression of innate immune signaling via nuclear compression. Thereafter, extracellular cords cause contact-dependent phagocyte death but grow intercellularly between epithelial cells. The absence of these mechanopathological mechanisms explains the greater proportion of alveolar lesions with increased immune infiltration and dissemination defects in cording-deficient Mtb infections. Compression of Mtb lipid monolayers induces a phase transition that enables mechanical energy storage. Agent-based simulations demonstrate that the increased energy storage capacity is sufficient for the formation of cords that maintain structural integrity despite mechanical perturbation. Bacteria in cords remain translationally active despite antibiotic exposure and regrow rapidly upon cessation of treatment. This study provides a conceptual framework for the biophysics and function in tuberculosis infection and therapy of cord architectures independent of mechanisms ascribed to single bacteria.",2023-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Mishra', 'firstname': 'Richa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hannebelle', 'firstname': 'Melanie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Patil', 'firstname': 'Vishal P', 'initials': 'VP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubois', 'firstname': 'Anaëlle', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'BioElectron Microscopy Facility, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia-Mouton', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University Complutense Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirsch', 'firstname': 'Gabriela M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jan', 'firstname': 'Maxime', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Competence Centre, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Bioinformatics Competence Centre, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Kunal', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Guex', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Bioinformatics Competence Centre, University of Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; Bioinformatics Competence Centre, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sordet-Dessimoz', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Histology Core Facility, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Perez-Gil', 'firstname': 'Jesus', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University Complutense Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Prakash', 'firstname': 'Manu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Knott', 'firstname': 'Graham W', 'initials': 'GW', 'affiliation': 'BioElectron Microscopy Facility, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dhar', 'firstname': 'Neeraj', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'McKinney', 'firstname': 'John D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Thacker', 'firstname': 'Vivek V', 'initials': 'VV', 'affiliation': 'Global Health Institute, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) drives MCL-1 expression (family member of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins) to limit apoptosis and grow intracellularly in human macrophages. The feasibility of re-purposing specific MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors to limit M.tb growth, using inhibitors that are in clinical trials and FDA-approved for cancer treatment has not be tested previously. We show that specifically inhibiting MCL-1 and BCL-2 induces apoptosis of M.tb-infected macrophages, and markedly reduces M.tb growth in human and murine macrophages, and in a pre-clinical model of human granulomas. MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibitors limit growth of drug resistant and susceptible M.tb in macrophages and act in additive fashion with the antibiotics isoniazid and rifampicin. This exciting work uncovers targeting the intrinsic apoptosis pathway as a promising approach for TB host-directed therapy.

Although numerous silicosis-related data have been published recently, emphasizing the characteristics and nature of silicosis, a summary of the developmental laws of research is lacking, especially in the visual analysis of the literature. We aim to address this issue through a scientometric review. The Web of Science Core Collection and the All Databases were searched with ""silicosis"" as the topic, excluding unrelated publications, and obtained data from 9802 and 1613 publications, respectively. The data was then analyzed using the Web of Science's online scientometric analysis function and CiteSpace's visual analysis functionality, including publication volume analysis, co-occurrence analysis, co-citation analysis, cluster analysis, and explosive detection. The results identify the ""respiratory system"" as the most influential area over a century. Furthermore, the publication's number was correlated with the gross domestic product. We ranked countries and institutions based on the frequency of publications and discovered that Europe, the USA, and China are the leading regions for silicosis research, with the USA and Europe having a stronger influence. Many reports related to artificial stone and denim jean production have been studied through citation analysis, indicating new epidemic trends in silicosis. Besides, silicosis-related diseases and the pathogenesis of silicosis were the research hotspots of silicosis through co-occurrence keyword analysis and outbreak detection.

Implementation of tuberculosis preventive therapy with INH-Rifapentine (3HP) for latent tuberculosis infection management in household tuberculosis contacts in India: A prospective study.,"['3HP', 'TB elimination', 'TB infection', 'TB preventive therapy', 'end-TB', 'latent TB', 'tuberculosis']",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,"The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the acceptance, initiation, implementation and treatment completion rates of tuberculosis (TB) preventive therapy (TPT) using 3HP (INH-Rifapentine) among household contacts of microbiologically confirmed drug sensitive TB cases on anti-tubercular treatment under programmatic real-world settings. The secondary objectives were to estimate the prevalence and predictors of latent TB infection (LTBI) in household contacts of the index TB cases. We also ascertained the safety profile of the 3HP TPT regimen in the household contacts.
This prospective observational study was conducted at 10 TB chest clinics in Delhi, India during 2022-2023. Household contacts aged 14 and older who tested positive for TB infection on a Tuberculin Skin test were initiated on the 3HP regimen. Logistic regression was performed by including statistically significant independent variables in multiple prediction models. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. STATA, version 15.1, was used to compute all analyses.
A total of 1067 (84.68%) eligible contacts of microbiologically confirmed, drug sensitive TB cases underwent screening with tuberculin skin test (TST), 614 (95.6%) LTBI positive contacts accepted the initiation of TPT, and 564 (91.8%) of those initiated on TPT completed the treatment. The major reason for refusal of screening was the lack of perception of risk of TB disease due to asymptomatic status. The prevalence of LTBI positivity through TST was 61.5% (95% CI, 58.5%, 64.4%). Adverse events were reported by 195 (31.8%) contacts initiated on 3HP of which 20 participants discontinued TPT. None of the sociodemographic factors showed a significant association with LTBI positivity (except age) or TPT completion rates.
LTBI management with 3HP is feasible among adolescent and adult household contacts in India with high rates of adherence from initiation until treatment completion.

The criteria of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and lymphocyte/neutrophil (L/N) ratio have yet not been evaluated across different disease conditions.
Patients who conducted pleural fluid analysis from 2009 to 2019 at Asan Medical Center were included. Criteria (ADA of 50 and L/N ratio of 0.75) were evaluated by quantile subgroups according to age, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC), and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) by the Monte Carlo simulation method to diagnose tuberculosis. The model for the ADA and L/N ratio was evaluated by AUROC.
Among the 2,918 reviewed cases, 2034 were included with 229 (11.26%) tuberculosis cases. The mean baseline ADA AUROC was 0.88 across all patients. Increased CRP and WBC showed high proportions of neutrophilic tuberculous effusion, with low sensitivity of approximately 45% and 33% in the fifth WBC and CRP groups, respectively. The AUROC of the models decreased with the increase in WBC and CRP groups (ADA model: 0.69 [the top quantile WBC group], 0.74 [the top quantile CRP group]).

In this study, we performed biological and genomic analyses of 239 C. tropicalis strains including 115 environmental and 124 human commensal isolates. Most (99.2%) of the isolates had a baseline diploid genome. The strains from both environmental and human niches exhibit similar abilities to survive under stressful conditions and produce secreted aspartic proteases. However, the human commensal isolates exhibited a stronger ability to filament than the environmental strains. We found that 19 environmental isolates (16.5%) and 24 human commensal isolates (19.4%) were resistant to fluconazole. Of the fluconazole-resistant strains, 37 isolates (86.0%) also exhibited cross-resistance to voriconazole. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses revealed that both environmental and commensal isolates were widely distributed in a number of genetic clusters but the two populations exhibited a close genetic association. The majority of fluconazole-resistant isolates were clustered within a single clade (X). The combination of hotspot mutations (Y132F and S154F) and genomic expansion of ERG11, which encodes the azole target lanosterol 14-α-demethylase and represents a major target of azole drugs, is a major mechanism for the development of azole resistance.

Transmission dynamics and phylogeography of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in China based on whole-genome phylogenetic analysis.,"['China', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'multidrug-resistant tuberculosis', 'transmission', 'whole genome sequence']",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,"To describe the lineage-specific transmissibility and epidemiological migration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in China.
We curated a large set of whole genome sequences from 3204 M. tuberculosis isolates, including thousands of newly sequenced genomes, and applied a series of metrics to compare the transmissibility of M. tuberculosis strains between lineages and sublineages. The countrywide transmission patterns of major lineages were explored.
We found that lineage 2 (L2) was the most prevalent lineage in China (85.7%), with the major sublineage 2.2.1 (80.9%), followed by lineage 4 (L4) (13.8%), which comprises major sublineages 4.2 (1.5%), 4.4 (6.2%) and 4.5 (5.8%). We showed evidence for frequent cross-regional spread and large cluster formation of L2.2.1 strains, whereas L4 strains were relatively geographically restricted in China. Next, we applied a series of genomic indices to evaluate M. tuberculosis strain transmissibility and uncovered higher transmissibility of L2.2.1 compared with the L2.2.2 and L4 sublineages. Phylogeographic analysis showed that southern, eastern, and northern China were highly connected regions for countrywide L2.2.1 strain spread.
The present study provides insights into the different transmission and migration patterns of the major M. tuberculosis lineages in China and highlights that transmissible L2.2.1 is a threat to tuberculosis control.",2023-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yi-Fan', 'initials': 'YF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the Third Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nutrition and Health, School of Public Health, Qingdao University, Qingdao, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kong', 'firstname': 'Xiang-Long', 'initials': 'XL', 'affiliation': 'Xiang-long Kong, Shandong Artificial Intelligence Institute Qilu University of Technology & Shandong Academy of Sciences, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Wan-Mei', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ya-Meng', 'initials': 'YM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ying-Ying', 'initials': 'YY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Wei-Wei', 'initials': 'WW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Jie-Yu', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Men', 'firstname': 'Dan', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'College of Geography and Environmental Science, Northwest Normal University, No. 967 Anning East Road, Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Chun-Bao', 'initials': 'CB', 'affiliation': 'Center for Integrative and Translational Medicine, Shandong Public Health Clinical Center, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Guo-Ru', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Weifang Respiratory Disease Hospital & Weifang No.2 People's hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Wen-Ge', 'initials': 'WG', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Weifang Respiratory Disease Hospital & Weifang No.2 People's hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Wen-Yu', 'initials': 'WY', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Weifang Respiratory Disease Hospital & Weifang No.2 People's hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Kun', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Weifang Respiratory Disease Hospital & Weifang No.2 People's hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.""}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Huai-Chen', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yao', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.

PE12 interaction with TLR4 promotes intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by suppressing inflammatory response.,"['Intracellular survival', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'NLRP3', 'PE12', 'TLR4']",International journal of biological macromolecules,"Macrophages serve as the primary immune cells responsible for the innate immune defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection within the host. Specifically, NLRP3, a member of the NLRs family, plays a significant role in conferring resistance against MTB infection. Conversely, MTB evades innate immune killing by impeding the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, although the precise mechanism remains uncertain. In this study, we have identified PE12 (Rv1172c), a member of the PE/PPE family proteins, as an extracellular protein of MTB. PE12 interacts with Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) in macrophages, forming the PE12-TLR4 complex which subsequently inhibits the transcription and expression of NLRP3. As a result, the transcription and secretion of IL-1β are reduced through the PE12-TLR4-NLRP3-IL-1β immune pathway. In vitro and in vivo experiments using a PE12-deficient strain (H37RvΔPE12) demonstrate a weakening of the suppression of the inflammatory response to MTB infection. Our findings highlight the role of the PE12 protein in not only inhibiting the transcription and release of inflammatory cytokines but also mediating the killing of MTB escape macrophages through TLR4 and inducing lung injury in MTB-infected mice. These results provide evidence that PE12 plays a significant role in the inhibition of the host immune response by MTB.",2023-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Jiajun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Yingying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zang', 'firstname': 'Xinxin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Tingting', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Fanruo', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dang', 'firstname': 'Guanghui', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, NO.678, Haping Street, Harbin 150069, PR China.

Although promising progress has been made in the development of tuberculosis vaccines, new vaccines that broaden the antigenic repertoire need to be developed to eradicate this illness. In this study, we used Mycobacterium tuberculosis ferritin BfrB and heat-shock protein GrpE to construct a novel multi-antigenic fusion protein, BfrB-GrpE (BG). BG protein was stably overexpressed in the soluble form in Escherichia coli at a high yield and purified via sequential salt fractionation and hydrophobic chromatography. Purified BG was emulsified in an adjuvant containing N, N'-dimethyl-N, N'-dioctadecylammonium bromide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, and cholesterol (DPC) to construct the BG/DPC vaccine, which stimulated strong cellular and humoral immune responses in mice. Moreover, combination of BG with our previously developed vaccine, Mtb10.4-HspX (MH), containing antigens from both the proliferating and dormant stages, significantly reduced the bacterial counts in the lungs and spleens of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Importantly, mice that received BG + MH/DPC after M. tuberculosis H37Rv infection survived slightly better (100% survival) than those that received the BCG vaccine (80% survival), although the difference was not statistically significant.

Factors associated with unsuccessful tuberculosis treatment among homeless persons in Brazil: A retrospective cohort study from 2015 to 2020.,[],PLoS neglected tropical diseases,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and a curable disease. In Brazil, TB treatment outcomes are particularly worse among homeless populations who are either of black race, malnourished or living with HIV/AIDS and other comorbidities. This study therefore evaluated factors associated with unsuccessful TB treatment among homeless population (HP) compared to those with shelter.
The study population was composed of 284,874 people diagnosed with TB in Brazil between 2015 and 2020 and reported in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN), among which 7,749 (2.72%) were homeless and 277,125 (97.28%) were sheltered. Cox regression analysis was performed with both populations to identify factors associated with unsuccessful TB treatment, and significant predictors of TB treatment outcomes. Results show that HP are more susceptible to unfavorable outcomes when compared to sheltered people (Hazard Ratio (HR): 2.04, 95% CI 1.82-2.28). Among the HP, illicit drug use (HR: 1.38, 95% CI 1.09-1.74), mental disorders (HR: 2.12, 95% CI 1.08-4.15) and not receiving directed observed treatment (DOT) (HR: 18.37, 95% CI 12.23-27.58) are significant predictors of poor treatment outcomes. The use of illicit drugs (HR: 1.53, 95% CI 1.21-1.93) and lack of DOT (HR: 17.97, 95% CI 11.71-27.59) are associated with loss to follow-up, while lack of DOT (HR: 15.66, 95% CI 4.79-51.15) was associated with mortality among TB patients.
Homeless population living in Brazil are twice at risk of having an unsuccessful treatment, compared to those who are sheltered, with illicit drugs use, mental disorders and lack of DOT as risk factors for unsuccessful TB outcomes. Our findings reinforce the arguments for an intersectoral and integral approach to address these determinants of health among the vulnerable homeless populations.",2023-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Silva Rodrigues', 'firstname': 'Osiyallê Akanni', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Mogaji', 'firstname': 'Hammed Oladeji', 'initials': 'HO', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Alves', 'firstname': 'Layana Costa', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Flores-Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Renzo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Data and Knowledge Integration for Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cremonese', 'firstname': 'Cleber', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Nery', 'firstname': 'Joilda Silva', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Collective Health, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.'}]",Tuberculosis.
Key performance indicators of COVID-19 contact tracing in Belgium from September 2020 to December 2021.,[],PloS one,"The goal of tracing, testing, and quarantining contacts of infected individuals is to contain the spread of infectious diseases, a strategy widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, limited research exists on the effectiveness of contact tracing, especially with regard to key performance indicators (KPIs), such as the proportion of cases arising from previously identified contacts. In our study, we analyzed contact tracing data from Belgium collected between September 2020 and December 2021 to assess the impact of contact tracing on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and understand its characteristics. Among confirmed cases involved in contact tracing in the Flemish and Brussels-Capital regions, 19.1% were previously identified as close contacts and were aware of prior exposure. These cases, referred to as 'known' to contact tracing operators, reported on average fewer close contacts compared to newly identified individuals (0.80 versus 1.05), resulting in fewer secondary cases (0.23 versus 0.28). Additionally, we calculated the secondary attack rate, representing infections per contact, which was on average lower for the 'known' cases (0.22 versus 0.25) between December 2020 and August 2021. These findings indicate the effectiveness of contact tracing in Belgium in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Although we were unable to quantify the exact number of prevented cases, our findings emphasize the importance of contact tracing as a public health measure.

In-depth interviews were conducted with participants at their pre-bronchoscopy visit (n = 17) and after they had undergone bronchoscopy (n = 23) to examine their perceptions and experiences with the procedure. Following consent, all interviews were audio recorded and later transcribed and typed in MS WORD. Local language interviews were translated into English by the social science interviewers. Qualitative analysis was performed manually following an inductive and emergent approach typical in thematic analysis. This study was approved by the Makerere University School of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee (MAKSS REC 09.18.220) and registered with the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST SS4785). Overall willingness to participate in bronchoscopy was high as many participants viewed the study as primarily a means of getting free health checks and determining their health status. Notably, despite extensive face to face counseling for this study coupled with the fact that our participants had been involved in prior research at the site, therapeutic misconception still played a pivotal role in willingness to participate in research bronchoscopy. Therapeutic misconception has important ethical and research implications in clinical research, which requires strategies to tackle it, even among a pool of potential participants who are knowledgeable about a disease or clinical care procedures.

We conducted a pulmonary TB prevalence survey to estimate current TB burden in Blantyre city, Malawi. From May 2019 to March 2020, 115 households in middle/high-density residential Blantyre, were randomly-selected from each of 72 clusters. Consenting eligible participants (household residents ≥ 18 years) were interviewed, including for cough (any duration), and offered HIV testing and chest X-ray; participants with cough and/or abnormal X-ray provided two sputum samples for microscopy, Xpert MTB/Rif and mycobacterial culture. TB disease prevalence and risk factors for prevalent TB were calculated using complete-case analysis, multiple imputation, and inverse probability weighting. Of 20,899 eligible adults, 15,897 (76%) were interviewed, 13,490/15,897 (85%) had X-ray, and 1,120/1,394 (80%) sputum-eligible participants produced at least one specimen, giving 15,318 complete cases (5,895, 38% men). 29/15,318 had bacteriologically-confirmed TB (189 per 100,000 complete-case (cc) / 150 per 100,000 with inverse weighting (iw)). Men had higher burden (cc: 305 [95% CI:144-645] per 100,000) than women (cc: 117 [95% CI:65-211] per 100,000): cc adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.70 (1.26-5.78). Other significant risk factors for prevalent TB on complete-case analysis were working age (25-49 years) and previous TB treatment, but not HIV status. Multivariable analysis of imputed data was limited by small numbers, but previous TB and age group 25-49 years remained significantly associated with higher TB prevalence.

AIDS-related deaths have been reduced by 60% since the peak in 2004. Potentially, the fight against the HIV epidemic was made more difficult with the outbreak of COVID-19. Thus, this study examined the implications of COVID-19 in the utilization of HIV care and treatment services among people living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Zimbabwe. The study aimed to identify the critical factors defining the utilization of HIV services at the advent of COVID-19 using the fifth revision of the Anderson Behavioral Model of Healthcare Utilization. The study utilized a concurrent triangulation design of which only one data collection phase was used. The quantitative data was collected from 2,157 people living with HIV on antiretroviral viral therapy through a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. On the other hand, qualitative data was collected through in-depth interviews. Regarding accessing ART refills, the study findings revealed that adolescents aged 15-19 (aOR = 2.16; 95% CI: 1.18-3.96) had higher odds of utilizing ART refills compared to their counterparts who were aged 20-24. Living in a rural area was associated with higher odds of utilizing the ART refill service (aOR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.49-3.24). Regarding accessing viral load monitoring adults aged 25-39 (aOR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26-0.66) were less likely to utilize viral load monitoring compared to young people aged 20-24. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher odds of utilizing the viral load monitoring service (aOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.36-2.87) than those not yet vaccinated. Living in a rural area was associated with higher odds of utilizing viral load monitoring (aOR = 1.50; 95% CI: 1.09-2.08). Regarding tuberculosis preventative therapy, adults aged 25-39 (aOR = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.20-0.47) were less likely to utilize tuberculosis preventative therapy compared to young people aged 20-24. Being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher odds of utilizing tuberculosis preventative therapy (aOR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.12-2.25) than those not yet vaccinated. Living in a rural area was associated with higher odds of utilizing tuberculosis preventive therapy (aOR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.19-2.08). Regarding tuberculosis screening being vaccinated for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher odds of utilizing tuberculosis screening services (aOR = 1.89; 95% CI: 1.41-2.54) than those not yet vaccinated. Although the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has dwindled, COVID-19 appears to come and go in waves, and a few countries are still recording relatively high cases. It is therefore likely that the factors associated with utilization of HIV services identified by the study such as age, residence, type of health facility, vaccination of COVID-19 and fear of contracting COVID-19, among others, need to be included when planning to improve access to health utilization.",2023-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Tapera', 'firstname': 'Talent', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Demography and Population Studies Programme, Schools of Public Health and Social Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. talent.tapera@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Odimegwu', 'firstname': 'Clifford', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Demography and Population Studies Programme, Schools of Public Health and Social Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Makoni', 'firstname': 'Tatenda', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Zimbabwe National Network of People Living With HIV (ZNNP+), Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Mukuwapasi', 'firstname': 'Waraidzo', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Zimbabwe National Network of People Living With HIV (ZNNP+), Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Chitiyo', 'firstname': 'Vivian', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Zvandiri, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Kadziyanike', 'firstname': 'Gilton', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Zimbabwe National Network of People Living With HIV (ZNNP+), Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Willis', 'firstname': 'Nicola', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Zvandiri, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Mutsinze', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Zvandiri, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Mawodzeke', 'firstname': 'Mather', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Zvandiri, Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Chimberengwa', 'firstname': 'Pugie', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Organisation for Public Health Interventions and Development (OPHID), Harare, Zimbabwe.'}, {'lastname': 'Phiri', 'firstname': 'Million', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Demography and Population Studies Programme, Schools of Public Health and Social Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.\nDepartment of Population Studies, Schools of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.'}]",HIV
"Verbal autopsy to assess causes of mortality among the economically productive age group in the tribal region of Melghat, central India.","['Economically productive age group', 'Melghat', 'tribal', 'verbal autopsy']",The Indian journal of medical research,"Verbal autopsy (VA) is the systematic and retrospective inquiry (from relatives) about the symptoms of an illness prior to death. In tribal India, 67-75 per cent of deaths occur at home with an unknown cause of death (CoD). Hence, the aim of this study was to determine the CoD in the 16-60 yr age group utilizing VA.
A prospective, community based longitudinal study was conducted in 32 tribal villages in the Melghat region of Maharashtra, between 2004 and 2020. Number of deaths and VAs in 16-60 yr age group were collected by village health workers (VHWs) and supervisors, verified by five different persons (internal-external) and cross-checked by three VA interpretation trained physicians. A modified version of WHO VA was used. Cause-specific mortality fractions were calculated.
Of the 1011 deaths recorded, mortality in males was significantly higher than females (P<0.001). A total of 763 VAs were conducted which revealed that tuberculosis was the leading CoD, followed by jaundice, heart diseases, diarrhoea, central nervous system infections and suicide. Suicides were significantly more common among males than in females (P=0.046). Significantly, more deaths occurred during the monsoon (P=0.002), especially diarrhoeal deaths (P=0.024).
The findings of this study suggest that, in Indian tribal areas, infectious diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and one of the major causes of deaths in economically productive age group.

Nanovaccines are effective vaccines when compared with conventional vaccines as they can induce both Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and also provide longer immunogenic memory. The nanocarriers used in vaccines act as adjuvant. They provide site-specific delivery of antigens and can be used in conjugation with immunostimulatory molecules for enhancing adjuvant therapy.

Prevalence and risk factors for long COVID and post-COVID-19 condition in Africa: a systematic review.,[],The Lancet. Global health,"An improved estimation of the clinical sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial in African countries, where the subject has received little attention despite more than 12 million reported cases and evidence that many more people were infected. We reviewed the evidence on prevalence, associated risk factors for long COVID, and systemic or sociocultural determinants of reporting long COVID.
We conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, the Living OVerview of Evidence platform, and grey literature sources for publications from Dec 1, 2019, to Nov 23, 2022. We included articles published in English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese that reported on any study type in Africa with participants of any age who had symptoms for 4 weeks or more after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. We excluded secondary research, comments, and correspondence. Screening and data extraction were performed by two reviewers. Summary estimates were extracted, including sociodemographic factors, medical history, prevalence of persistent symptoms, and symptoms and associated factors. Results were analysed descriptively. The study was registered on the Open Science Framework platform.
Our search yielded 294 articles, of which 24 peer-reviewed manuscripts were included, reporting on 9712 patients from eight African countries. Only one study exclusively recruited children, and one other study included children as part of their study population. Studies indicated moderate to low risk of bias. Prevalence of long COVID varied widely, from 2% in Ghana to 86% in Egypt. Long COVID was positively associated with female sex, older age, non-Black ethnicity, low level of education, and the severity of acute infection and underlying comorbidity. HIV and tuberculosis were not identified as risk factors. Factors influencing reporting included absence of awareness, inadequate clinical data and diagnostics, and little access to health-care services.
In Africa, research on long COVID is scarce, particularly among children, who represent the majority of the population. However, existing studies show a substantial prevalence across settings, emphasising the importance of vaccination and other prevention strategies to avert the effects of long COVID on individual wellbeing, the increased strain on health systems, and the potential negative effects on economically vulnerable populations. At a global level, including African countries, tools for research on long COVID need to be harmonised to maximise the usefulness of the data collected.

Discovery and development of inhibitors of acetyltransferase Eis to combat Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"['Antibacterial agents', 'Crystal structure', 'Drug resistance', 'High-throughput assay', 'Infectious diseases']",Methods in enzymology,"Aminoglycosides are bactericidal antibiotics with a broad spectrum of activity, used to treat infections caused mostly by Gram-negative pathogens and as a second-line therapy against tuberculosis. A common resistance mechanism to aminoglycosides is bacterial aminoglycoside acetyltransferase enzymes (AACs), which render aminoglycosides inactive by acetylating their amino groups. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an AAC called Eis (enhanced intracellular survival) acetylates kanamycin and amikacin. When upregulated as a result of mutations, Eis causes clinically important aminoglycoside resistance; therefore, Eis inhibitors are attractive as potential aminoglycoside adjuvants for treatment of aminoglycoside-resistant tuberculosis. For over a decade, we have studied Eis and discovered several series of Eis inhibitors. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for a colorimetric assay used for high-throughput discovery of Eis inhibitors, their characterization, and testing their selectivity. We describe protocols for in vitro cell culture assays for testing aminoglycoside adjuvant properties of the inhibitors. A procedure for obtaining crystals of Eis-inhibitor complexes and determining their structures is also presented.

Commonly, small-molecule drugs are identified using screening, rational design, and structural biology approaches. Drug screening, testing and optimization is typically conducted in vitro, and copious amounts of protein are required. The advent of recombinant DNA technologies has resulted in a rise in proteins purified by affinity techniques, typically by incorporating an ""affinity tag"" at the N- or C-terminus. Use of these tagged proteins and affinity techniques comes with a host of issues. This chapter describes the production of an untagged enzyme, α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (MCR) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using a recombinant E. coli system. Purification of the enzyme on a 100 mg scale using tandem anion-exchange chromatographies (DEAE-sepharose and RESOURCE-Q columns), and size-exclusion chromatographies is described. A modified protocol allowing the purification of cationic proteins is also described, based on tandem cation-exchange chromatographies (using CM-sepharose and RESOURCE-S columns) and size-exclusion chromatographies.

Genetic clues to COVID-19 severity: exploring the stromal cell-derived factor-1/CXCL12 rs2839693 polymorphism in adult Egyptians.,"['COVID-19', 'CXCL12', 'Mild', 'Polymorphism', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'Severe']",BMC infectious diseases,"A novel corona virus called SARS-CoV-2 was identified at the end of December 2019, and the illness induced by it was designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severity of the disease could vary significantly since most of the infected individuals experience mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover without specialized care. Genetic polymorphisms have implications in influencing the varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. This study aims to assess the potential association between the CXCL12 rs2839693 polymorphism and the severity of COVID-19 in Assiut University Quarantine Hospital during the period from May 2022 to August 2022.
The present study is a cross-sectional study and is applied to 300 COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR admitted to Assiut University Quarantine Hospital from May 2022 to August 2022. Based on the clinical symptoms, the recruited participants had been divided into two groups. Group I involved mild or moderate cases; Group II involved severe or critical conditions. The rs2839693 polymorphism was detected by real time PCR using TaqMan assay probe.
The frequency of the T allele and the TT genotype was significantly higher in the severe or critical group compared with the mild or moderate group (p value < 0.001). C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimers are significantly elevated in the combined variants (CT + TT) and the TT compared with the CC (P value 0.006 and 0.017 respectively) and the CC,CT genotypes (p value 0.019 and 0.002 respectively). The combined variants (CT + TT) of CXCL12 were found to be independent predictors to severe or critical COVID-19 risk with P value =  < 0.001, OR = 3.034& 95% CI = 1.805-5.098.
Our findings revealed that CXCL12 rs2839693 had a role in the development and seriousness of COVID-19.

Constructing an extracellular matrix-related prognostic model for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis based on machine learning.,"['Bioinformatics', 'Extracellular matrix', 'IPF', 'Immune infiltration', 'Prognosis']",BMC pulmonary medicine,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease. Multiple research has revealed that the extracellular matrix (ECM) may be associated with the development and prognosis of IPF, however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood.
We included GSE70866 dataset from the GEO database and established an ECM-related prognostic model utilizing LASSO, Random forest and Support vector machines algorithms. To compare immune cell infiltration levels between the high and low risk groups, we employed the ssGSEA algorithm. Enrichment analysis was conducted to explore pathway differences between the high-risk and low-risk groups. Finally, the model genes were validated using an external validation set consisting of IPF cases, as well as single-cell data analysis.
Based on machine learning algorithms, we constructed an ECM-related risk model. IPF patients in the high-risk group had a worse overall survival rate than those in the low-risk group. The model's AUC predictive values were 0.786, 0.767, and 0.768 for the 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates, respectively. The validation cohort validated these findings, demonstrating our model's effective prognostication. Chemokine-related pathways were enriched through enrichment analysis. Moreover, immune cell infiltration varied significantly between the two groups. Finally, the validation results indicate that the expression levels of all the model genes exhibited significant differential expression.

Improving the communication between farmers and veterinarians to enhance the acceptability of bovine tuberculosis eradication programmes.,"['Cattle', 'Communication', 'Metaphors', 'Participatory methods', 'Press analysis']",Preventive veterinary medicine,"France and Spain have been fighting against bovine tuberculosis (bTB) for years, even though new outbreaks continue to appear on both sides of the border, generating misconceptions about the disease and social distrust in the eradication programme and competent authorities. The perceived disease risk and the commitment of all interested parties are key factors for the successful implementation of control programmes, as they might influence the acceptability of recommended measures. Effective communication can contribute to increasing knowledge, trust and stakeholders' engagement, thus ensuring the acceptability of the eradication programme. This study was conducted in Catalonia (Spain) and Pyrenees-Atlantiques (France) in the frame of the INNOTUB project (https://innotub.eu/) to characterise the communication on bTB in the trans-Pyrenees region and provide recommendations to improve it. The communication on bTB was characterised by analysing 153 (Spain) and 66 (France) online freely available texts, published between 2018 and 2020, through Content Analysis and Critical Metaphor Analysis. Moreover, six farmers and four veterinarians were in-depth interviewed in each area to gather information about the communication on bTB. Interviews were made in original languages and analysed using a qualitative thematic approach. A pilot participatory intervention inspired by the Systematic Tool for Behavioural Assumption Validation and Exploration (STAVE) method was used to develop a list of proposals to improve communication and to promote the creation of territorial networks/committees on bTB prevention and control. It included three focus groups with farmers and veterinarians, a meeting with representatives of the regional veterinary services, and a final deliberative workshop. Results highlight the existence of a controversial debate on bTB and a heterogeneous understanding between stakeholders. Institutional and scientific communication mainly focus on bTB detection and control while other aspects are left in the background. On the contrary, farmers extend their communication to a greater variety of topics. The metaphorical framing strongly differed among actors, while veterinary services and researchers ""fight"" against bTB and ""progress"" toward the eradication, farmers place themselves in a framework of ""sacrifice"" and, particularly in Spain, they play a passive role. The proposals developed by the participants to improve the current communication on bTB included: (i) create participatory meeting spaces to share opinions and information; (ii) improve data accessibility (on epidemiological situations); (iii) develop clearer and written protocols and informative visual material; (iv) redesign the training courses (v) increase the stakeholders' participation in the design of protocols.",2023-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Ciaravino', 'firstname': 'Giovanna', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Departament de Sanitat i Anatomia Animals, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), Bellaterra, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.

The unseen casualties of the First World War: insights from a randomly selected military sample.,[],The New Zealand medical journal,"Studies of the morbidity burden of military personnel participating in the First World War (WWI) have tended to focus on specific outcomes (e.g., injuries). Therefore, we aimed for a more complete assessment.
From a random sample of active war service-exposed New Zealand WWI veterans used in previously published work, we examined a random subsample of 200 personnel. Data on diagnoses, hospitalisations and outcomes were extracted from the online archival military files.
These personnel experienced a very high morbidity burden with 94% having at least one new condition diagnosed during their military service (mean: 2.4 per individual; range: 0 to 8). The relative severity of these conditions was reflected by the high level of hospitalisation (89% at least once; mean: 1.8 hospitalisations for new conditions per individual) and 59% of personnel being deemed no longer fit for military service at some stage. More of the new diagnoses were for infectious diseases than for conflict-related injuries (117 vs 50 cases per 100 personnel). Respiratory conditions such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis affected 33% of personnel, and 14% were diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections. Diseases reflecting hazardous environmental conditions were relatively common e.g., for dysentery/gastroenteritis in 12% and scabies in 5% of personnel. Diagnoses suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were present in 10% and chemical warfare injuries in 6%.
The overall morbidity burden of this military force in WWI was very high, and much higher than the previous official estimates.",2023-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Nick', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Otago Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Summers', 'firstname': 'Jennifer A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Otago Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Harper', 'firstname': 'Glyn', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomson', 'firstname': 'George', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, University of Otago Wellington, New Zealand.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que están hablando en este fragmento es la: NO_IDENTIFICADO
Tuberculosis incidence in foreign-born people residing in European countries in 2020.,"['TB', 'migrants', 'policy', 'prevention', 'refugees']",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,"BackgroundEuropean-specific policies for tuberculosis (TB) elimination require identification of key populations that benefit from TB screening.AimWe aimed to identify groups of foreign-born individuals residing in European countries that benefit most from targeted TB prevention screening.MethodsThe Tuberculosis Network European Trials group collected, by cross-sectional survey, numbers of foreign-born TB patients residing in European Union (EU) countries, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK) in 2020 from the 10 highest ranked countries of origin in terms of TB cases in each country of residence. Tuberculosis incidence rates (IRs) in countries of residence were compared with countries of origin.ResultsData on 9,116 foreign-born TB patients in 30 countries of residence were collected. Main countries of origin were Eritrea, India, Pakistan, Morocco, Romania and Somalia. Tuberculosis IRs were highest in patients of Eritrean and Somali origin in Greece and Malta (both > 1,000/100,000) and lowest among Ukrainian patients in Poland (3.6/100,000). They were mainly lower in countries of residence than countries of origin. However, IRs among Eritreans and Somalis in Greece and Malta were five times higher than in Eritrea and Somalia. Similarly, IRs among Eritreans in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK were four times higher than in Eritrea.ConclusionsCountry of origin TB IR is an insufficient indicator when targeting foreign-born populations for active case finding or TB prevention policies in the countries covered here.

The situation has undoubtedly been made more difficult by the widespread and multidrug-resistant (XDR) strains of TB. The modification of existing anti-TB medications to produce derivatives that can function on resistant TB bacilli is one of the potential techniques to overcome drug resistance affordably and straightforwardly. In comparison to novel pharmaceuticals for drug research and progress, these may have a better half-life and greater bioavailability, be more efficient, and serve as inexpensive alternatives. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is drugsusceptible or drug-resistant, is effectively treated by several already prescribed medications and their derivatives. Due to this, the current review attempts to give a brief overview of the rifampicin derivatives that can overcome the parent drug's resistance and could, hence, act as useful substitutes. It has been found that one-third of the global population is affected by M. tuberculosis. The most common cause of infection-related death can range from latent TB to TB illness. Antibiotics in the rifamycin class, including rifampicin or rifampin (RIF), rifapentine (RPT), and others, have a special sterilizing effect on M. tuberculosis. We examine research focused on evaluating the safety, effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, risk of medication interactions, and other characteristics of RIF analogs. Drug interactions are especially difficult with RIF because it must be taken every day for four months to treat latent TB infection. RIF continues to be the gold standard of treatment for drug-sensitive TB illness. RIF's safety profile is well known, and the two medicines' adverse reactions have varying degrees of frequency. The authorized once-weekly RPT regimen is insufficient, but greater dosages of either medication may reduce the amount of time needed to treat TB effectively.",2023-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Asif', 'firstname': 'Mohammad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Era College of Pharmacy, Era University, Lucknow, 226003, Uttar Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Qusty', 'firstname': 'Naeem F', 'initials': 'NF', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al‒Qura University, Makkah, 21955, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Alghamdi', 'firstname': 'Saad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Umm Al‒Qura University, Makkah, 21955, Saudi Arabia.'}]",Enfermedad: Tuberculosis

There is a lack of national-level representative qualitative data to study COVID-19-related stigma among healthcare workers in India. The present study explores factors associated with stigma and manifestations experienced by Indian healthcare workers involved in COVID-19 management. We conducted in-depth interviews across 10 centres in India, which were analysed using NVivo software version 12. Thematic and sentiment analysis was performed to gain deep insights into the complex phenomenon by categorising the qualitative data into meaningful and related categories. Healthcare workers (HCW) usually addressed the stigma they encountered when doing their COVID duties under the superordinate theme of stigma. Among them, 77.42% said they had been stigmatised in some way. Analyses revealed seven interrelated themes surrounding stigma among healthcare workers.

We assessed the prevalence of depressive symptoms and their association with age, chronic conditions, and health status among middle-aged and elderly people in peri-urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Depressive symptoms were measured in 2,220 adults aged over 40 years from two wards of Dar es Salaam using the ten-item version of the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) and a cut-off score of 10 or higher. The associations of depressive symptoms with age, 13 common chronic conditions, multimorbidity, self-rated health and any limitation in six activities of daily living were examined in univariable and multivariable logistic regressions.
The estimated prevalence of depressive symptoms was 30.7% (95% CI 28.5-32.9). In univariable regressions, belonging to age groups 45-49 years (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.04-1.75]) and over 70 years (OR 2.35 [95% CI 1.66-3.33]), chronic conditions, including ischemic heart disease (OR 3.43 [95% CI 2.64-4.46]), tuberculosis (OR 2.42 [95% CI 1.64-3.57]), signs of cognitive problems (OR 1.90 [95% CI 1.35-2.67]), stroke (OR 1.56 [95% CI 1.05-2.32]) and anemia (OR 1.32 [95% CI 1.01-1.71]) and limitations in activities of daily living (OR 1.35 [95% CI 1.07-1.70]) increased the odds of depressive symptoms. Reporting good or very good health was associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms (OR 0.48 [95% CI 0.35-0.66]).

PixelPrint: A collection of three-dimensional printed CT phantoms of different respiratory diseases.,"['3D printing', 'Computed tomography', 'image quality phantoms', 'lung', 'quality assurance']",Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,"Imaging is often a first-line method for diagnostics and treatment. Radiological workflows increasingly mine medical images for quantifiable features. Variability in device/vendor, acquisition protocol, data processing, etc., can dramatically affect quantitative measures, including radiomics. We recently developed a method (PixelPrint) for 3D-printing lifelike computed tomography (CT) lung phantoms, paving the way for future diagnostic imaging standardization. PixelPrint generates phantoms with accurate attenuation profiles and textures by directly translating clinical images into printer instructions that control density on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The present study introduces a library of 3D printed lung phantoms covering a wide range of lung diseases, including usual interstitial pneumonia with advanced fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, secondary tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, Kaposi sarcoma, and pulmonary edema. CT images of the patient-based phantom are qualitatively comparable to original CT images, both in texture, resolution and contrast levels allowing for clear visualization of even subtle imaging abnormalities. The variety of cases chosen for printing include both benign and malignant pathology causing a variety of alveolar and advanced interstitial abnormalities, both clearly visualized on the phantoms. A comparison of regions of interest revealed differences in attenuation below 6 HU. Identical features on the patient and the phantom have a high degree of geometrical correlation, with differences smaller than the intrinsic spatial resolution of the scans. Using PixelPrint, it is possible to generate CT phantoms that accurately represent different pulmonary diseases and their characteristic imaging features.",2023-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Mei', 'firstname': 'Kai', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Roshkovan', 'firstname': 'Leonid', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pasyar', 'firstname': 'Pouyan', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shapira', 'firstname': 'Nadav', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gang', 'firstname': 'Grace J', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stayman', 'firstname': 'J Webster', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Geagan', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Noël', 'firstname': 'Peter B', 'initials': 'PB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}]","Enfermedad: Diversas enfermedades pulmonares (usual interstitial pneumonia with advanced fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, secondary tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, Kaposi sarcoma, and pulmonary edema)"

However, studies on the ferroptosis-related diagnostic markers in tuberculosis (TB) is still lacking. Our study aimed to explore the role of ferroptosis-related biomarkers and molecular subtypes in TB.
GSE83456 dataset was applied to identify ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) associated with TB, and GSE42826, GSE28623, and GSE34608 datasets for external validation of core biomarkers. Core FRGs were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Subsequently, two ferroptosis-related subtypes were constructed based on ferroptosis score, and differently expressed analysis, GSEA, GSEA, immune cell infiltration analysis between the two subtypes were performed.Affiliations: Please check and confirm that the authors and their respective affiliations have been correctly identified and amend if necessary.correctly RESULTS: A total of 22 FRGs were identified, of which three genes (CHMP5, SAT1, ZFP36) were identified as diagnostic biomarkers that were enriched in pathways related to immune-inflammatory response. In addition, TB patients were divided into high- and low-ferroptosis subtypes (HF and LF) based on ferroptosis score. HF patients had activated immune- and inflammation-related pathways and higher immune cell infiltration levels than LF patients.

This study attempted to employ scRNA-seq technology to map the potentially hidden single cell landscape of influenza H5N6.
High-quality transcriptomes were generated from scRNA-seq data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were taken from a critically-ill child diagnosed with H5N6 avian influenza infection and one healthy control donor. Cluster analysis was then performed on the scRNA-seq data to identify the different cell types. The pathways, pseudotime developmental trajectories and gene regulatory networks involved in different cell subpopulations were also explored.

This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of TBM in older patients with those in younger and middle-aged patients.
This single-center retrospective study extracted data on the clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid changes, laboratory results, imaging features, and outcomes of patients with TBM from patient medical records and compared the findings in older patients (aged 60 years and older) with those of younger and middle-aged patients (aged 18-59 years).
The study included 197 patients with TBM, comprising 21 older patients aged 60-76 years at onset, and 176 younger and middle-aged patients aged 18-59 years at onset. Fever was common in both older (81%) and younger and middle-aged patients (79%). Compared with younger and middle-aged patients, older patients were more likely to have changes in awareness levels (67% vs. 40%), peripheral nerve dysfunction (57% vs. 29%), changes in cognitive function (48% vs. 20%), and focal seizures (33% vs. 6%), and less likely to have headache (71% vs. 93%), neck stiffness on meningeal stimulation (38% vs. 62%), and vomiting (47% vs. 68%). The Medical Research Council staging on admission of older patients was stage II (52%) and stage III (38%), whereas most younger and middle-aged patients had stage I (33%) and stage II (55%) disease. Neurological function evaluated on the 28th day of hospitalization was more likely to show poor prognosis in older patients than in younger and middle-aged patients (76% vs. 25%). Older patients had significantly higher red blood cell counts and blood glucose levels, and significantly lower serum albumin and sodium levels than those in younger and middle-aged patients. The cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, nucleated cell counts, glucose levels, and chloride levels did not differ significantly by age.

This study aims to describe the geographic distribution of COVID-19, TB and leprosy incidence and to identify common socioeconomic risk factors.
The total number of new cases of COVID-19, TB and leprosy, as well as socioeconomic and demographic variables, were retrieved from official registers. The geographical distribution of COVID-19, TB and leprosy rates per neighbourhood was visualised in Quantum GIS, and spatial autocorrelation was measured with Moran's I in GeoDa. A spatial regression model was applied to understand the association between COVID-19, TB, leprosy rates, and socioeconomic factors.
COVID-19 and TB showed a more homogenous distribution, whereas leprosy is located more in the south and west of Fortaleza. One neighbourhood (Pedras) in the southeast was identified as high endemic for all three diseases. Literacy was a socioeconomic risk factor for all three diseases: a high literacy rate increases the risk of COVID-19, and a low literacy rate (i.e., illiteracy) increases the risk of TB and leprosy. In addition, high income was associated with COVID-19, while low income with TB.
Despite the similar mode of transmission, COVID-19, TB and leprosy show a different distribution of cases in Fortaleza. In addition, associated risk factors are related to wealth in COVID-19 and to poverty in TB and leprosy. These findings may support policymakers in developing (partially combined) primary and secondary prevention considering the efficient use of resources.",2023-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Taal', 'firstname': 'A T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'NLR, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.taal@nlrinternational.org.\nErasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. a.taal@nlrinternational.org.'}, {'lastname': 'Barreto', 'firstname': 'J G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Federal University of Pará, Belém, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Santos de Sousa', 'firstname': 'G Dos', 'initials': 'GD', 'affiliation': 'Fortaleza Municipal Health Secretariat, Fortaleza, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'da Rocha', 'firstname': 'A Medeiros', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'NHR Brasil, Fortaleza, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Lima Ferreira', 'firstname': 'N N', 'initials': 'NN', 'affiliation': 'NHR Brasil, Fortaleza, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Menezes da Silva', 'firstname': 'J A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'NHR Brasil, Fortaleza, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Hinders', 'firstname': 'D C', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': 'NLR, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van Brakel', 'firstname': 'W H', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': 'NLR, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Richardus', 'firstname': 'J H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Blok', 'firstname': 'D J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.'}]","COVID-19, TB, leprosy"
Evaluation of different diagnostic methods for spinal tuberculosis infection.,"['Diagnosis', 'Metagenomic next-generation sequencing', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Spinal tuberculosis', 'Xpert MTB/RIF']",BMC infectious diseases,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the most fatal infectious disease worldwide. Approximately 24.6% of tuberculosis cases are extrapulmonary and predominantly affect the spine. It is difficult to diagnose spinal TB (STB). We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT)-960 culture, T-SPOT.TB, Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB)/resistance to rifampin (RIF), and Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) to detect STB.
We assessed 126 patients presumed to have STB using these four methods. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using clinical diagnosis as a reference.
Of the patients, 41 were diagnosed with STB and 85 with non-STB. In the STB group, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the MGIT-960 culture were 29.3% (12/41), 100% (85/85), 100% (12/12), and 74.6% (85/114), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of T-SPOT.TB were 92.7% (38/41), 82.4% (70/85), 58.5% (31/53), and 95.9% (70/73), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were 53.7% (22/41), 100% (85/85), 100% (22/22), and 81.7% (85/104), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of mNGS were 39.0% (16/41), 98.8% (84/85), 94.1% (16/17), and 77.1% (84/109), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of mNGS + Xpert MTB/RIF were 73.2% (30/41), 100% (85/85), 96.8% (30/31), and 72.0% (85/118), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the mNGS + T-spot assay were 97.6% (40/41), 100% (85/85), 67.9% (38/56), and 75.9% (85/113), respectively. Moreover, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of T-spot + Xpert MTB/RIF were 95.1% (39/41), 100% (85/85), 72.2% (39/54), and 81.0% (85/105), respectively.
T-SPOT.TB is the most effective method for diagnosing STB; however, Xpert MTB/RIF is more reliable and can detect RIF resistance. Clinicians can use mNGS to identify pathogens in patients with spinal infections; these pathogens appeared to be more meaningful in guiding the clinical management of patients in the non-STB group. The combination of Xpert MTB/RIF and mNGS can improve the early diagnosis rate and drug resistance detection, reduce the diagnostic cycle, and provide early targeted anti-TB treatment for patients with STB.",2023-10-19,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Zhaoxin', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xiu', 'firstname': 'Xin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shi', 'firstname': 'Zhenpeng', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Qiang', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Orthopedics, Shandong Public Health Clinical Center, Shandong, China. zq-9999@163.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Deqiang', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong, China. jadcdq@163.com.\nDepartment of Spinal Orthopedics, Shandong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong, China. jadcdq@163.com.'}]",Enfermedad: Tuberculosis Espinal (STB)

This study aimed to present the sociodemographic and epidemiological profile of HP notified for TB from 2015 to 2019 in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro and to analyze relationships between the variables studied and TB outcomes. This is a cross-sectional study with secondary data on TB notifications in HP in the period and place of the study. Descriptive analysis was performed, followed by analysis of the association between selected variables and TB outcomes with chi-square test and multinomial logistic regression to obtain the odds ratio (OR). The profile of HP with TB is men (74.9%), blacks (76.2%), with a mean age of 43.3 years (SD = 12.0), aged from 30 to 59 years (78.5%). The most frequent outcome was treatment withdrawal (43.3%), followed by cure (29.9%), and death (3.6%). The analyses showed that black individuals (OR = 1.4; 95%CI: 1.1-1.9), drug (OR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.3-2.3) and alcohol use (OR = 1.3; 95%CI: 1.0-1.7) were risk factors for treatment withdrawal and that age groups older than 30 years or older (OR = 0.7; 95%CI: 0.5-0.9) and the extrapulmonary form (OR = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.1-0.6) were protective factors. The vulnerability of the HP is particularized in racial and gender profiles, as well as TB, thus reinforcing effective prevention and treatment actions is necessary to increase access to health services and the fight against TB in this context. And pay attention to the high proportion of incomplete data that limit the analyses for this problem.

Differences in responses to the intracellular macrophage environment between Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine strains Moreau and Pasteur.,[],Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz,"The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine comprises a family of strains with variable protective efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy, partly due to genetic differences between strains.
Previous data highlighting differences between the genomes and proteomic profiles of BCG strains Moreau and Pasteur led us to evaluate their behaviour in the macrophage microenvironment, capable of stimulating molecular responses that can impact the protective effect of the vaccine.
Strain infectivity, viability, co-localisation with acidified vesicles, macrophage secretion of IL-1 and MCP-1 and lipid droplet biogenesis were evaluated after infection.
We found that BCG Moreau is internalised more efficiently, with significantly better intracellular survival up to 96 h p.i., whereas more BCG Pasteur bacilli were found co-localised in acidified vesicles up to 6 h p.i. IL-1β and MCP-1 secretion and lipid droplet biogenesis by infected macrophages were more prominent in response to BCG Pasteur.
Overall, our results show that, compared to Pasteur, BCG Moreau has increased fitness and better endurance in the harsh intracellular environment, also regulating anti-microbial responses (lower IL-1b and MCP-1).

"Baseline and acquired resistance to bedaquiline, linezolid and pretomanid, and impact on treatment outcomes in four tuberculosis clinical trials containing pretomanid.",[],PLOS global public health,"Bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa) and linezolid (L) are key components of new regimens for treating rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB). However, there is limited information on the global prevalence of resistance to these drugs and the impact of resistance on treatment outcomes. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) phenotypic drug susceptibility and whole-genome sequence (WGS) data, as well as patient profiles from 4 pretomanid-containing trials-STAND, Nix-TB, ZeNix and SimpliciTB-were used to investigate the rates of baseline resistance (BR) and acquired resistance (AR) to BPaL drugs, as well as their genetic basis, risk factors and impact on treatment outcomes. Data from >1,000 TB patients enrolled from 2015 to 2020 in 12 countries was assessed. We identified 2 (0.3%) participants with linezolid BR. Pretomanid BR was also rare, with similar rates across TB drug resistance types (0-2.1%). In contrast, bedaquiline BR was more prevalent among participants with highly resistant TB or longer prior treatment histories than those with newly diagnosed disease (5.2-6.3% vs. 0-0.3%). Bedaquiline BR was a risk factor for bacteriological failure or relapse in Nix-TB/ZeNix; 3/12 (25%, 95% CI 5-57%) participants with vs. 6/185 (3.2%, 1.2-6.9%) without bedaquiline BR. Across trials, we observed no linezolid AR, and only 3 cases of bedaquiline AR, including 2 participants with poor adherence. Overall, pretomanid AR was also rare, except in ZeNix patients with bedaquiline BR. WGS analyses revealed novel mutations in canonical resistant genes and, in 7 MTB isolates, the genetic determinants could not be identified. The overall low rates of BR to linezolid and pretomanid, and to a lesser extent to bedaquiline, observed in the pretomanid trials are in support of the worldwide implementation of BPaL-based regimens. Similarly, the overall low AR rates observed suggest BPaL drugs are better protected in the regimens trialed here than in other regimens combining bedaquiline with more, but less effective drugs.",2023-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Timm', 'firstname': 'Juliano', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'TB Alliance, New York City, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bateson', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Solanki', 'firstname': 'Priya', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Paleckyte', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Witney', 'firstname': 'Adam A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': ""Institute of Infection and Immunity, St George's, University of London, London, United Kingdom.""}, {'lastname': 'Rofael', 'firstname': 'Sylvia A D', 'initials': 'SAD', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.\nFaculty of Pharmacy, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt.'}, {'lastname': 'Fabiane', 'firstname': 'Stella', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Olugbosi', 'firstname': 'Morounfolu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'TB Alliance, Pretoria, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'McHugh', 'firstname': 'Timothy D', 'initials': 'TD', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Eugene', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'TB Alliance, New York City, New York, United States of America.'}]",rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis
Developing contents for a digital adherence tool: A formative mixed-methods study among children and adolescents living with HIV in Tanzania.,[],PLOS digital health,"Optimal adherence (>95%) to antiretroviral treatment (ART) remains a challenge among children and adolescents living with HIV (CALHIV). Digital adherence tools (DAT) with reminder cues have proven feasible among adult people living with HIV (PLHIV), with some concerns about the risk of HIV status disclosure. We aimed to assess the needs, contents and acceptability of an SMS-based DAT among CALHIV. We first conducted a survey to understand potential barriers to using DAT among CALHIV, then tested the DAT intervention among purposively selected participants. The DAT intervention included using the Wisepill device, receiving daily reminder SMS and receiving adherence reports on how they had taken medication in the past month. The content of the reminder SMS differed over time from asking if the medication was taken to a more neutral SMS like ""take care"". Afterwards, we conducted exit interviews, in-depth interviews, and focus-group discussions. We analysed quantitative findings descriptively and used thematic content analysis for qualitative data. We included 142 children and 142 adolescents in the survey, and 20 of each used the intervention. Eighty-five percent (121/142) of surveyed participants indicated they would like to receive reminder SMS. Most of them (97/121-80%) of children and 94/121(78%) of adolescents would prefer to receive daily reminders. Participants who used the DAT mentioned to be happy to use the device. Ninety percent of them had good experience with receiving reminders and agreed that the SMS made them take medication. However, 25% experienced network problems. Participants preferred neutral reminder SMSs that did not mention the word 'medication', but preserved confidentiality. The provided adherence reports inspired participants to improve their adherence. None of the participants experienced unwanted disclosure or stigmatisation due to DAT. However, 5% of adolescents were concerned about being monitored daily. This study showed that DAT is acceptable and provided insight of the needed SMS content for a customized DAT for CALHIV.",2023-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Swai', 'firstname': 'Iraseni Ufoo', 'initials': 'IU', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.\nUMC Amsterdam, Location AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ten Bergen', 'firstname': 'Lisa Lynn', 'initials': 'LL', 'affiliation': 'Amsterdam UMC, location University of Amsterdam, Department of Global Health, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nVrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Mtenga', 'firstname': 'Alan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.\nIfakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Maro', 'firstname': 'Rehema', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.\nIfakara Health Institute, Bagamoyo, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Ngowi', 'firstname': 'Kennedy', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.\nUMC Amsterdam, Location AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Mtesha', 'firstname': 'Benson', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Lekashingo', 'firstname': 'Naomi', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.'}, {'lastname': 'Msosa', 'firstname': 'Takondwa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'UMC Amsterdam, Location AMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nHelse Nord Tuberculosis Initiative, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi.'}, {'lastname': 'Rinke de Wit', 'firstname': 'Tobias F', 'initials': 'TF', 'affiliation': 'Amsterdam UMC, location University of Amsterdam, Department of Global Health, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nPharmAccess Foundation, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Aarnoutse', 'firstname': 'Rob', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Radboud university medical center, Department of Pharmacy, Research Institute for Medical Innovation, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Sumari-de Boer', 'firstname': 'Marion', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute, Moshi, Tanzania.\nAmsterdam UMC, location University of Amsterdam, Department of Global Health, Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\nInstitute of Public Health, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, Moshi, Tanzania.'}]",Enfermedad: VIH/SIDA.
Clinical characteristics and morbidity among hospitalized adults with advanced HIV disease in Uganda during 'test and treat' era.,[],PLOS global public health,"Nearly four decades after the first case of AIDS was described, the global number of AIDS-related deaths has steadily declined but falls short of the elimination targets, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite interventions to promote early HIV diagnosis and treatment, hospitalization and mortality related to advanced HIV disease (AHD) remains a significant public health problem in Uganda. We assessed the HIV treatment history and causes of hospitalization among in-patients with AHD at a tertiary hospital in Uganda. In this cross-sectional study, pre-hospitalization HIV treatment history and clinical characteristics of HIV-positive in-patients with CD4<200 cells/μL or WHO stage 3 or 4 clinical events were assessed. Descriptive data were summarized using percentages and medians. Among hospitalized adults with AHD from November 2021 to June 2022, 74% (260/353) knew their HIV status prior to hospitalization and 62% (219/353) were ART experienced at presentation. The median time since ART initiation was 28 months (IQR; 2-97). Overall, 73% (258/353) had at least two etiological diagnoses and the majority (non-mutually exclusive) were diagnosed with tuberculosis (61.2%), cryptococcal meningitis (20.7%), mucosal candidiasis (16.1%) and bacterial infections (15%). In conclusion, nearly two-thirds of in-patients with advanced HIV disease were ART experienced prior to hospitalization and tuberculosis was the most common cause of hospitalization.

Population-Modifiable Risk Factors Associated With Childhood Stunting in Sub-Saharan Africa.,[],JAMA network open,"Identifying modifiable risk factors associated with childhood stunting in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is imperative for the development of evidence-based interventions and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
To evaluate key modifiable risk factors associated with childhood stunting in SSA.
This cross-sectional study examined the most recent (2014-2021) Demographic and Health Surveys data for children younger than 5 years from 25 SSA countries.
Modifiable risk factors included history of diarrhea within 2 weeks, consumption of dairy products, maternal body mass index, maternal educational level, antenatal care visits, place of birth, wealth index, type of toilet, and type of cooking fuel.
Stunting and severe stunting, measured using the height-for-age z score, were the main outcomes. Children who scored below -2.0 SDs or -3.0 SDs were classified as having stunted or severely stunted growth, respectively. Relative risks and 95% CIs were computed using generalized linear latent and mixed models and log-binomial link functions. Population-attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated using adjusted relative risks and prevalence estimates for key modifiable risk factors.
This study included 145 900 children from 25 SSA countries. The mean (SD) age of the children was 29.4 (17.3) months, and 50.6% were male. The highest PAFs of severe childhood stunting were observed for mothers lacking a formal education (PAF, 21.9%; 95% CI, 19.0%-24.8%), children lacking consumption of dairy products (PAF, 20.8%; 95% CI, 16.8%-24.9%), unclean cooking fuel (PAF, 9.5%; 95% CI, 2.6%-16.3%), home birth (PAF, 8.3%; 95% CI, 6.3%-10.0%), and low-income household (PAF, 5.8%; 95% CI, 3.4%-8.0%). These 5 modifiable risk factors were associated with 51.6% (95% CI, 40.5%-60.9%) of the severe childhood stunting in SSA.
This cross-sectional study identified 5 modifiable risk factors that were associated with 51.6% of severe childhood stunting in SSA.

We present a patient with concomitant cancer and tuberculosis of lungs whose postoperative period was complicated by bronchial stump failure. Preoperative diagnostic data are presented. We describe the indications for surgeries and main surgical stages. Some interventions including reconstructive surgery using a muscle flap led to recovery.

Southeast Asia,"The World Health Organization (WHO) South East Asia Region (SEAR) comprises 11 countries, which are one of the most culturally, topographically, and socially diverse areas worldwide, undergoing an epidemiological transition towards non-communicable diseases, including stroke and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This region accounts for over 40% of the global stroke mortality. Few well-designed population-based epidemiological studies on stroke are available from SEAR countries, with considerable variations among them. Ischemic stroke, a common stroke subtype, has higher frequencies of intracerebral hemorrhage in many countries. Along with an aging population, the increased prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco and alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, high ambient pollution, heat, and humidity contribute to the high burden of stroke in this region. SEAR's many unique and uncommon stroke etiologies include cerebral venous thrombosis, tuberculosis, dengue, scrub typhus, falciparum malaria, snake bite, scorpion sting, etc. Current data on stroke burden and risk factors is lacking, compelling an urgent need for high-quality hospital-level and population-level data in all SEAR countries.

Reconstruction of complicated spinal tuberculosis with long-segment fibula transplantation: a case report.,"['Abscess', 'Debridement', 'Free fibula graft', 'Kyphosis', 'Orthopedic', 'Spinal tuberculosis']",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,"Treating complex cases of spinal tuberculosis (STB) that involve multiple vertebral bodies and cause destruction of the spinal structure, kyphotic deformity, and acute nerve injury can be challenging. This report describes the course of treatment and 5-year follow-up of a complex case of multisegmental STB.
This report describes a case of tuberculosis affecting the vertebrae extending from thoracic 12 to lumbar 5 in a 60-year-old woman who suffered sudden paralysis in both lower extremities. The patient underwent emergency posterior paraspinal abscess clearance, laminectomy with spinal decompression. Partial correction of the kyphotic deformity via long-segment fixation from the T9 vertebral body to the ilium in a one-stage posterior procedure. The patient's neurological status was diagnosed as grade E on the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scale after the one-stage operation. Following standardized 4-combination anti-tuberculosis drug therapy for three months in postoperative patients, the patient underwent two-stage transabdominal anterior abscess removal, partial debridement of the lesion and bilateral fibula graft support. One year after the two-stage operation, the patient's visual analog scale (VAS) score of back pain was 1 point, and the patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels returned to normal. Five years after the second-stage operation, the Oswestry disability index (ODI) of patient quality of life was 14 points. There was a 4-degree change in the Cobb angle over five years. During the five-year follow-up period, the grafted fibula did not experience any subsidence.
For patients with spinal tuberculosis and acute paralysis, it is essential to relieve spinal cord compression as soon as possible to recover spinal cord function. For lesions that cannot be debrided entirely, although limited debridement combined with anti-tuberculosis drug therapy has the risk of sinus formation and tuberculosis recurrence, it is much safer than the risk of thorough debridement surgery. In this case, an unconventional long-segment fibula graft, pelvis-vertebral support, was an effective reconstruction method.",2023-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'RuiYang', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'FeiFan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Qing', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Fan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'JianFeng', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ru', 'firstname': 'Neng', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Orthopedics Department, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China. 32541038@qq.com.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que están hablando es tuberculosis espinal (STB).
Aortic endograft infection by Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense with acquired clarithromycin resistance: a case report.,"['Aortic endograft infection', 'Case report', 'Macrolide resistance', 'Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense']",BMC infectious diseases,"Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense (MMA) comprises a group of non-tuberculous, rapidly growing mycobacteria. Although MMA can cause pulmonary diseases, surgical site infections, and disseminated diseases, aortic endograft infection has not been reported. Here, we describe the first case of aortic endograft infection caused by MMA.
Two months after stent-graft insertion for an abdominal aortic aneurysm, an 85-year-old man was admitted with fever and abdominal pain and was diagnosed with aortic endograft infection. Despite 14 days of meropenem and vancomycin intravenous administration, periaortic fluid pooling increased as compared to that before antibiotic administration. The abscess was drained, and fluorescent acid-fast staining of the abscess fluid revealed bacilli. We conducted genetic tests on the genes hsp65, rpoB, and sodA, performed Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and identified the organism as MMA. Intravenous imipenem-cilastatin (IPM/CS), amikacin (AMK), and oral clarithromycin (CAM) were administered. After 2 months, oral CAM and sitafloxacin were administered because the abscess had decreased in size. However, after 6 weeks, the abscess increased in size again. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the drainage fluid from the abscess resulted in the isolation of an MMA strain that had acquired resistance to CAM. Intravenous IPM/CS, AMK, and oral linezolid were added to the treatment regimen along with oral CAM and STFX. However, he was not fully cured and died 6 months later. Neither the full-length erythromycin ribosome methyltransferase (erm)(41) gene nor the rrl or rpIV gene mutations were found by Sanger sequencing in the pre- and post-treatment strains. Whole-genome sequence analysis of the post-treatment strain revealed mutations in genes with no previous reports of association with macrolide resistance.
Aortic endograft infection caused by MMA strain is extremely rare; nonetheless, MMA should be suspected as the causative microorganism when broad-spectrum antimicrobials are ineffective.",2023-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Akiyama', 'firstname': 'Yutaro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan. yakiyama@hosp.ncgm.go.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Iwamoto', 'firstname': 'Noriko', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamada', 'firstname': 'Keisuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mycobacterium Reference and Research, The Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, 3-1-24 Matsuyama, Kiyose-shi, Tokyo, 204-8533, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshida', 'firstname': 'Atsushi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo Metropolitan Geriatric Hospital and Institute of Gerontology, 35-2 Sakae-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, 173-0015, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Osugi', 'firstname': 'Asami', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mycobacterium Reference and Research, The Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, 3-1-24 Matsuyama, Kiyose-shi, Tokyo, 204-8533, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Mitarai', 'firstname': 'Satoshi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mycobacterium Reference and Research, The Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association, 3-1-24 Matsuyama, Kiyose-shi, Tokyo, 204-8533, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Tetsuya', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Kei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nagashima', 'firstname': 'Maki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Horai', 'firstname': 'Tetsuya', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohmagari', 'firstname': 'Norio', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Disease Control and Prevention Center, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que están hablando es la infección del injerto aórtico causada por Mycobacterium abscessus subsp. massiliense (MMA).

We discover that Mtb promotes lipid droplets by inhibiting DNA repair responses, resulting in the activation of the type-I IFN pathway and scavenger receptor-A1 (SR-A1)-mediated lipid droplet formation. Bacterial urease C (UreC, Rv1850) inhibits host DNA repair by interacting with RuvB-like protein 2 (RUVBL2) and impeding the formation of the RUVBL1-RUVBL2-RAD51 DNA repair complex. The suppression of this repair pathway increases the abundance of micronuclei that trigger the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and subsequent interferon-β (IFN-β) production. UreC-mediated activation of the IFN-β pathway upregulates the expression of SR-A1 to form lipid droplets that facilitate Mtb replication. UreC inhibition via a urease inhibitor impaired Mtb growth within macrophages and in vivo. Thus, our findings identify mechanisms by which Mtb triggers a cascade of cellular events that establish a nutrient-rich replicative niche.",2023-10-18,"[{'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Shanshan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Key Laboratory of Pathogen-Host Interaction, Ministry of Education, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200433, P.R.

Effect of Host Cholesterol on the Membrane Dynamics of Outer Membrane Lipids of Mycobacteria.,"['Cholesterol', 'Membrane order', 'Membrane-drug interactions', 'Mycobacterial membrane lipids', 'Phase-segregated lipid domains']","Chemistry, an Asian journal","The ability of mycobacterium tuberculosis to remain dormant after primary infection, represent the prime cause of new TB cases throughout the world. Hence, diagnosis and treatment of individuals hosting dormant mycobacterium is one of the crucial strategies to be adopted for the prevention of Tuberculosis. Among many strategies unleashed by the latent bacterium, one of them is scavenging host cholesterol for carbon source. Cholesterol modifies lipid membranes over many scales and here, its effect on mycobacterial membrane biophysics and the subsequent effect on partitioning of antibiotics into cholesterol- enriched mycobacterial membranes was investigated. Our research showed that cholesterol alters the phase state behavior of mycobacterial outer membrane lipids by enhancing the overall membrane order at the headgroup and acyl chain region and is integrated into both ordered and disordered domains/phases, with a preference for the latter. Exogenous cholesterol further alters the drug partitioning behavior of structurally different drugs, pointing to a larger clinical potential of using more hydrophobic medications to target dormant bacteria.",2023-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Adhyapak', 'firstname': 'Pranav', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Chemistry, INDIA.'}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Kuan', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, CHINA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kapoor', 'firstname': 'Shobhna', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Chemistry, Powai, 40076, Mumbai, INDIA.'}, {'lastname': 'Duan', 'firstname': 'Mojie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Chinese Academy of Sciences Innovation Academy for Precision Measurement Science and Technology, Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, CHINA.'}]",Tuberculosis
From Simple to Sinister: Kaposi Sarcoma Masquerading as a Subconjunctival Hemorrhage.,"['acquired immunodeficiency syndrome', 'aids', 'conjunctival kaposi sarcoma', 'hiv', 'immunocompromised', 'kaposi', 'kaposi sarcoma', 'retrovirus', 'subconjunctival hemorrhage']",Cureus,"A young male in his early 30s presented with spontaneous left eye redness for three months associated with blood-stained eye discharge. There was no history of trauma, blood dyscrasias, or anticoagulant intake. On examination, visual acuity was normal in both eyes. An anterior segment examination of the left eye showed subconjunctival hemorrhage with a fleshy bright red conjunctival mass hidden in the inferotemporal fornix. Other parts of the ocular examination including the contralateral eye were unremarkable. Upon further inquiry, the patient revealed a history of a retroviral disease diagnosed eight years ago but had not pursued treatment. Systemic examination revealed a raised non-pigmented lesion of the tongue and a painless purplish plaque at the back. Investigations showed a high viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) load and confirmed the Kaposi sarcoma of the conjunctiva, tongue, and skin; cryptococcal meningitis; smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis; and late latent syphilis. He was comanaged by multidisciplinary teams. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was commenced. Treatment was a challenge considering the simultaneous presence of malignancy and a serious fungal infection of the brain in an immunosuppressed patient. Fortunately, three months post treatment, he showed remarkable improvement as there was almost a complete resolution of conjunctival Kaposi sarcoma.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) and Human Immunodeficiency virus infection: dilemmas in diagnosis and management: a case series.,"['Advanced HIV disease', 'Aquaporin-4', 'Autoimmune diseases', 'Case report', 'MOGAD', 'Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)', 'Opportunistic infections']",Journal of medical case reports,"Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a recently described autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system (CNS). There is limited data on the association between Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and MOGAD. We report three patients with HIV infection and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies in the setting of other central nervous system infections.
The first patient, a 44-year-old black African man, presented with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with positive serum MOG antibodies. He made a significant recovery with corticosteroids but had a quick relapse and died from sepsis. The second patient, an 18-year-old black woman, presented with paraplegia and imaging revealed a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and had positive serum MOG antibodies. She remained paraplegic after methylprednisone and plasmapheresis treatments. Her rehabilitation was complicated by development of pulmonary embolism and tuberculosis. The third patient, a 43-year-old mixed-race woman, presented with bilateral painless visual loss. Her investigations were notable for positive MOG antibodies, positive Varicella Zoster Virus on cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and hyperintense optic nerves on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Her vision did not improve with immunosuppression and eventually died from sepsis.
Our cases illustrate the diagnostic and management challenges of MOGAD in the setting of advanced HIV infection, where the risk of CNS opportunistic infections is high even without the use of immunosuppression. The atypical clinical progression and the dilemmas in the diagnosis and treatment of these cases highlight gaps in the current knowledge of MOGAD among people with HIV that need further exploration.",2023-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Gadama', 'firstname': 'Yohane', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa. yggadama@medcol.mw.\nMalawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, Kamuzu University of Health Sciences, Blantyre, Malawi. yggadama@medcol.mw.'}, {'lastname': 'Du Preez', 'firstname': 'Marié', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Carr', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Theron', 'firstname': 'Sarel', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Albertyn', 'firstname': 'Christine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Ssebambulidde', 'firstname': 'Kenneth', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Research Department, Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.'}, {'lastname': 'Saylor', 'firstname': 'Deanna', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brey', 'firstname': 'Naeem', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Henning', 'firstname': 'Franclo', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que hablan en este fragmento es Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein Antibody-Associated Disease (MOGAD)
Prevalence and predictors of tuberculosis among HIV patients who completed isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) at Reach out Mbuya community health initiative.,[],Scientific reports,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals in Sub Saharan Africa, including Uganda. Isoniazid prophylaxis therapy (IPT) is a major public health intervention to limit tuberculosis disease among people living with HIV. However, there is limited information about the influence of IPT on TB disease incidence and its associated risk factors among HIV positive patients in Uganda especially at Reach out-Mbuya community health initiative hence the study. A cross sectional study was conducted among HIV positive adult patients who completed a 6-months long daily treatment of Isoniazid preventive therapy. Sputum samples and urine samples were collected and analysed using Gene Xpert and lateral flow urine Lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) tests respectively for presence of Tuberculosis disease. Data analysis was performed using STATA (version 14). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to assess the risk factors associated with tuberculosis among the study population and significance estimated at 95% confidence level. A total of 103 HIV positive adults was studied. The mean age of the participants was 42.1 (10.5) and median age was 43 (IQR = 16). The prevalence of tuberculosis disease among HIV positive adult patients who completed Isoniazid preventive therapy was 5.8% (6/103). Counselling, the only significant factor, reduced the likelihood of occurrence of TB disease among HIV patients on IPT treatment (aOR:0.028, P-value < 0.001). A low prevalence of TB disease was observed among HIV patients on IPT treatment. Counselling is a protective factor of TB disease among HIV patients on IPT treatment.",2023-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Sekayi', 'firstname': 'Wycliff', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University, P.O.

Bifurcation analysis of a tuberculosis progression model for drug target identification.,[],Scientific reports,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The emergence and rapid spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains urge us to develop novel treatments. Experimental trials are constrained by laboratory capacity, insufficient funds, low number of laboratory animals and obsolete technology. Systems-level approaches to quantitatively study TB can overcome these limitations. Previously, we proposed a mathematical model describing the key regulatory mechanisms underlying the pathological progression of TB. Here, we systematically explore the effect of parameter variations on disease outcome. We find five bifurcation parameters that steer the clinical outcome of TB: number of bacteria phagocytosed per macrophage, macrophages death, macrophage killing by bacteria, macrophage recruitment, and phagocytosis of bacteria. The corresponding bifurcation diagrams show all-or-nothing dose-response curves with parameter regions mapping onto bacterial clearance, persistent infection, or history-dependent clearance or infection. Importantly, the pathogenic stage strongly affects the sensitivity of the host to these parameter variations. We identify parameter values corresponding to a latent-infection model of TB, where disease progression occurs significantly slower than in progressive TB. Two-dimensional bifurcation analyses uncovered synergistic parameter pairs that could act as efficient compound therapeutic approaches. Through bifurcation analysis, we reveal how modulation of specific regulatory mechanisms could steer the clinical outcome of TB.",2023-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Flores-Garza', 'firstname': 'Eliezer', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Biología Molecular y Biotecnología, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510, Mexico, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Hernández-Pando', 'firstname': 'Rogelio', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Sección de Patología Experimental, Departamento de Patología, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Vasco de Quiroga 15, Belisario Domínguez Secc. 16, Tlalpan, 14080, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'García-Zárate', 'firstname': 'Ibrahim', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, Coyoacán, 04510, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Aguirre', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Matemática, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Casilla 110-V, Valparaíso, Chile.'}, {'lastname': 'Domínguez-Hüttinger', 'firstname': 'Elisa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Biología Molecular y Biotecnología, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Ciudad Universitaria, 04510, Mexico, Mexico. elisa.dominguez@iibiomedicas.unam.mx.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que hablan en este fragmento es la Tuberculosis (TB).
Structural Optimization of Antimycobacterial Azaaurones Towards Improved Solubility and Metabolic Stability.,['azaaurones * M. tuberculosis * drug discovery * drug-resistant tuberculosis * Structure-activity relationships'],ChemMedChem,"While N-acetyl azaaurones have already been disclosed for their potential against tuberculosis (TB), their low metabolic stability remains an unaddressed liability. We now report a study designed to improve the metabolic stability and solubility of the azaaurone scaffold and to identify the structural requirements for antimycobacterial activity. Replacing the N-acetyl moiety for a N-carbamoyl group led to analogues with sub- and nanomolar potencies against M. tuberculosis H37Rv, as well as equipotent against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. The new N-carbamoyl azaaurones exhibited improved microsomal stability, compared to their N-acetylated counterparts, with several compounds displaying moderate to high kinetic solubility. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to azaaurones was observed to be in the range of 10-8, a value that is comparable to current TB drugs in the market. Overall, these results reveal that azaaurones are amenable to structural modifications to improve metabolic and solubility liabilities, and highlight their potential as antimycobacterial agents.",2023-10-17,"[{'lastname': 'Campaniço', 'firstname': 'André', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Trinity College Dublin School of Chemistry, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute, 152 - 160 Pearse Street, D02 R590, Dublin, IRELAND.'}, {'lastname': 'Harjivan', 'firstname': 'Shrika G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Freitas', 'firstname': 'Elisabete', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Serafini', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Gaspar', 'firstname': 'Manuela M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Capela', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Gomes', 'firstname': 'Pedro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Jordaan', 'firstname': 'Audrey', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences, Molecular Mycobacteriology Research Unit, Department of Pathology and Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, SOUTH AFRICA.'}, {'lastname': 'Madureira', 'firstname': 'Ana M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'André', 'firstname': 'Vânia', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Instituto Superior Técnico: Universidade de Lisboa Instituto Superior Tecnico, Centro de Química Estrutural, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Silva', 'firstname': 'Andreia B', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, FFUL, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Duarte', 'firstname': 'M Teresa', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Instituto Superior Técnico: Universidade de Lisboa Instituto Superior Tecnico, Centro de Química Estrutural, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Portugal', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Perdigão', 'firstname': 'João', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Moreira', 'firstname': 'Rui', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}, {'lastname': 'Warner', 'firstname': 'Digby F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': 'University of Cape Town Faculty of Health Sciences, Wellcome Centre for Infectious Diseases Research in Africa, SOUTH AFRICA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lopes', 'firstname': 'Francisca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmácia: Universidade de Lisboa Faculdade de Farmacia, iMed.ULisboa, PORTUGAL.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que hablan es la tuberculosis (TB).
Accuracy of package inserts of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests: a secondary analysis of manufacturer versus systematic review data.,[],The Lancet. Microbe,"Rapid antigen tests (RATs) were crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. Information provided by the test manufacturer in product package inserts, also known as instructions for use (IFUs), is often the only data available to clinicians, public health professionals, and individuals on the diagnostic accuracy of these tests. We aimed to assess whether manufacturer IFU accuracy data aligned with evidence from independent research.
We searched company websites for package inserts for RATs that were included in the July 2022 update of the Cochrane meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RATs, which served as a benchmark for research evidence. We fitted bivariate hierarchical models to obtain absolute differences in sensitivity and specificity between IFU and Cochrane Review estimates for each test, as well as overall combined differences.
We found 22 (100%) of 22 IFUs of the RATs included in the Cochrane Review. IFUs for 12 (55%) of 22 RATs reported statistically significantly higher sensitivity estimates than the Cochrane Review, and none reported lower estimates. The mean difference between IFU and Cochrane Review sensitivity estimates across tests was 12·0% (95% CI 7·5-16·6). IFUs in three (14%) of 22 diagnostic tests had significantly higher specificity estimates than the Cochrane Review and two (9%) of 22 had lower estimates. The mean difference between IFU and Cochrane Review specificity estimates across tests was 0·3% (95% CI 0·1-0·5). If 100 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested with each of the tests in this study, on average 12 fewer people would be correctly diagnosed than is suggested by the package inserts.
Health professionals and the public should be aware that package inserts for SARS-CoV-2 RATs might provide an overly optimistic picture of the sensitivity of a test. Regulatory bodies should strengthen their requirements for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy data in package inserts and policy makers should demand independent validation data for decision making.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis suppresses APLP2 expression to enhance its survival in macrophage.,"['Aplp2', 'Cytokines production', 'M.tb', 'NF-κB transcriptional activity']",International immunopharmacology,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), the most successful pathogen responsible for approximately 1.6 million deaths in 2021, employs various strategies to evade host antibacterial defenses, including mechanisms to counteract nitric oxide (NO) and certain cytokines. While Amyloid β (A4) precursor-like protein 2 (Aplp2) has been implicated in various physiological and pathological processes, its role in tuberculosis (TB) pathogenesis remains largely uncharted. This study unveils a significant reduction in Aplp2 levels in TB patients, M.tb-infected macrophages, and mice. Intriguingly, Aplp2 mutation or knockdown results in diminished macrophage-mediated killing of M.tb, accompanied by decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and reduced cytokine production, notably interleukin-1β (Il-1β). Notably, Aplp2 mutant mice exhibit heightened susceptibility to mycobacterial infection, evident through aggravated histopathological damage and increased lung bacterial loads, in contrast to Mycobacterium bovis BCG-infected wild-type (WT) mice. Mechanistically, the cleaved product of APLP2, AICD2, generated by γ-secretase, translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with p65, culminating in enhanced the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcriptional activity.

Batch normalization followed by merging is powerful for phenotype prediction integrating multiple heterogeneous studies.,[],PLoS computational biology,"Heterogeneity in different genomic studies compromises the performance of machine learning models in cross-study phenotype predictions. Overcoming heterogeneity when incorporating different studies in terms of phenotype prediction is a challenging and critical step for developing machine learning algorithms with reproducible prediction performance on independent datasets. We investigated the best approaches to integrate different studies of the same type of omics data under a variety of different heterogeneities. We developed a comprehensive workflow to simulate a variety of different types of heterogeneity and evaluate the performances of different integration methods together with batch normalization by using ComBat. We also demonstrated the results through realistic applications on six colorectal cancer (CRC) metagenomic studies and six tuberculosis (TB) gene expression studies, respectively. We showed that heterogeneity in different genomic studies can markedly negatively impact the machine learning classifier's reproducibility. ComBat normalization improved the prediction performance of machine learning classifier when heterogeneous populations are present, and could successfully remove batch effects within the same population. We also showed that the machine learning classifier's prediction accuracy can be markedly decreased as the underlying disease model became more different in training and test populations. Comparing different merging and integration methods, we found that merging and integration methods can outperform each other in different scenarios. In the realistic applications, we observed that the prediction accuracy improved when applying ComBat normalization with merging or integration methods in both CRC and TB studies. We illustrated that batch normalization is essential for mitigating both population differences of different studies and batch effects. We also showed that both merging strategy and integration methods can achieve good performances when combined with batch normalization. In addition, we explored the potential of boosting phenotype prediction performance by rank aggregation methods and showed that rank aggregation methods had similar performance as other ensemble learning approaches.",2023-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Yilin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Fengzhu', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, United States of America.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que habla el documento es el cáncer colorrectal (CRC) y tuberculosis (TB).

CD8+ lymphocytes are critical for early control of tuberculosis in macaques.,[],The Journal of experimental medicine,"The functional role of CD8+ lymphocytes in tuberculosis remains poorly understood. We depleted innate and/or adaptive CD8+ lymphocytes in macaques and showed that loss of all CD8α+ cells (using anti-CD8α antibody) significantly impaired early control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, leading to increased granulomas, lung inflammation, and bacterial burden. Analysis of barcoded Mtb from infected macaques demonstrated that depletion of all CD8+ lymphocytes allowed increased establishment of Mtb in lungs and dissemination within lungs and to lymph nodes, while depletion of only adaptive CD8+ T cells (with anti-CD8β antibody) worsened bacterial control in lymph nodes. Flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing revealed polyfunctional cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes in control granulomas, while CD8-depleted animals were unexpectedly enriched in CD4 and γδ T cells adopting incomplete cytotoxic signatures. Ligand-receptor analyses identified IL-15 signaling in granulomas as a driver of cytotoxic T cells. These data support that CD8+ lymphocytes are required for early protection against Mtb and suggest polyfunctional cytotoxic responses as a vaccine target.",2023-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Winchell', 'firstname': 'Caylin G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.\nDivision of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.\nCenter for Vaccine Research, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine , Pittsburgh, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nyquist', 'firstname': 'Sarah K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Program in Computational and Systems Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge, MA, USA.\nBroad Institute, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge, MA, USA.\nDepartment of Chemistry, Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, and Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA, USA.\nComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and Department of Mathematics, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Michael C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, Harvard T.

The effects of various penalty parameter values in Q.Clear algorithm for rectal cancer detection on ,"['18F-FDG', 'Bayesian method', 'Image reconstruction', 'PET-CT']",EJNMMI physics,"The Q.Clear algorithm is a fully convergent iterative image reconstruction technique. We hypothesize that different PET/CT scanners with distinct crystal properties will require different optimal settings for the Q.Clear algorithm. Many studies have investigated the improvement of the Q.Clear reconstruction algorithm on PET/CT scanner with LYSO crystals and SiPM detectors. We propose an optimum penalization factor (β) for the detection of rectal cancer and its metastases using a BGO-based detector PET/CT system which obtained via accurate and comprehensive phantom and clinical studies.
OSEM had 11.5-18.6% higher BV than Q.Clear using β value of 500. Conversely, RC from OSEM to Q.Clear using β value of 500 decreased by 3.3-7.7% for a sphere with a diameter of 10 mm and 2.5-5.1% for a sphere with a diameter of 37 mm. Furthermore, the increment of contrast using a β value of 500 was 5.2-8.1% in the smallest spheres compared to OSEM. When the β value was increased from 100 to 500, the SNR increased by 49.1% and 30.8% in the smallest and largest spheres at LBR 2:1, respectively. At LBR of 8:1, the relative difference of SNR between β value of 100 and 500 was 43.7% and 44.0% in the smallest and largest spheres, respectively. In the clinical study, as β increased from 100 to 500, the SUVmax decreased by 47.7% in small and 31.1% in large lesions. OSEM demonstrated the least SUVmax, SBR, and contrast. The decrement of SBR and contrast using OSEM were 13.6% and 12.9% in small and 4.2% and 3.4%, respectively, in large lesions.
Implementing Q.Clear enhances quantitative accuracies through a fully convergent voxel-based image approach, employing a penalization factor. In the BGO-based scanner, the optimal β value for small lesions ranges from 200 for LBR 2:1 to 300 for LBR 8:1. For large lesions, the optimal β value is between 400 for LBR 2:1 and 500 for LBR 8:1.

The study used a quasi-experimental study design. A semi-structured checklist was used for health facility assessment and a self-administered questionnaire of HCPs. Pre- and postintervention assessments were made in urban primary health centers (UPHCs), HCPs, and patients. Interventions included sharing facility-specific recommendations, AIC plans and guidelines, HCP training, and patient education. Statistical difference between the two time periods was assessed using the Chi-square test.
A total of 23 and 25 UPHCs were included for pre- and postintervention assessments. All 25 centers participated in interventions. Open areas were >20% of ground area in all facilities. No AIC committee was present in any of the facilities at both pre- and postintervention. Of all HCPs, 7% (23/337) versus 65% (202/310) had undergone AIC training.

It is characterized by rapid growth and invasion of nearby tissues. It typically presents as a rapidly growing goiter or nodule that is firm to the touch and firmly attached to the underlying structures. Case reports of unusual presentations of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma have been reported. The presentation of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma mimicking cervical tuberculosis is very unusual. We reported a case of a 65-year-old patient who had a left cervical swelling that had been evolving for 4 months, causing dysphagia. Initial imaging showed a necrotic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid, communicating with a second necrotic mass in the subcutaneous tissue that was fistulized to the skin and suggesting cervical tuberculosis. The mass was incised with pus and whitish material resembling caseous tuberculosis was discharged. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative and biopsy revealed a nonspecific granulomatous lesion.

Primary Tuberculosis of Buccal and Labial Mucosa: Literature Review and a Rare Case Report of a Public Health Menace.,[],Case reports in dentistry,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic granulomatous infectious disorder, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Despite the recent advancements in antitubercular therapy (ATT), it remains a global public health concern. TB is a leading infectious cause of global mortality, second only to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). TB of the oral cavity is an uncommon occurrence and may be classified as a primary and secondary form. The primary tubercular lesions are extremely rare, as the intact oral squamous epithelium resists the entry of tubercle bacilli. The commonest oral TB lesion is solitary ulceration with undermined edges, usually on the tongue, that does not exhibit healing with conservative therapies. Owing to the atypical presentation, the oral TB lesions often go unnoticed during clinical examination; hence, an oral physician should be familiar with the various oral manifestations of TB. A timely diagnosis coupled with interdisciplinary treatment is the key to combat disease dissemination. This manuscript aims to report a rare case of primary tuberculosis of the buccal and labial mucosa in a 43-year-old immunocompetent male patient. Buccal and labial mucosa are the infrequently affected sites for primary oral TB lesions.

Demographic information was collected using a custom-designed questionnaire, and lung function was measured using spirometry. We used multivariate logistic regression to explore the possible relationship between biomass fuels exposure and COPD, as well as between other potential risk factors and COPD. Bayes' theorem was used to estimate weights for different COPD risk factors.
COPD was newly diagnosed in 500 of the 11398 adults surveyed, corresponding to an incidence of 4.39%. Individuals who were exposed to biomass fuels were at a significantly greater risk of developing COPD than those not exposed (OR 2.58, 95% CI 2.23-3.05). In subgroup analysis, exposure to biomass fuels increased the risk of COPD in men by 1.71 times (95% CI 1.09-2.68) and in women by 2.88 times (95% CI 2.01-3.48), in never-smokers by 2.18 times. Bayesian weights for COPD risk factors were highest for poor kitchen ventilation (W=31.13%) and biomass fuels exposure (W=18.08%).

However, it remains unclear why some patients do not benefit from the treatment as much or have a rapid disease progression. It is considered that, apart from the oncogenic driver gene, molecular alterations in a number of caretaker and gatekeeper genes significantly impact the efficacy of targeted therapies.The tumor protein 53 (TP53) gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in NSCLC. To date, numerous studies have investigated the influence of various TP53 alterations on patient prognosis and responsiveness to therapies targeting EGFR, ALK, or ROS1. This review focuses on the latest data concerning the role of TP53 alterations as prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers for EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in advanced NSCLC patients. Since the presence of TP53 mutations in NSCLC has been linked to its decreased responsiveness to EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 targeted therapy in most of the referenced studies, the review also discusses the impact of TP53 mutations on treatment resistance.It seems plausible that assessing the TP53 mutation status could aid in patient stratification for optimal clinical decision-making. However, drawing meaningful conclusions about the clinical value of the TP53 co-mutations in EGFR-, ALK- or ROS1-positive NSCLC is hampered mainly by an insufficient knowledge regarding the functional consequences of the TP53 alterations. The integration of next-generation sequencing into the routine molecular diagnostics of cancer patients will facilitate the detection and identification of targetable genetic alterations along with co-occurring TP53 variants. This advancement holds the potential to accelerate understanding of the biological and clinical role of p53 in targeted therapies for NSCLC.",2023-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Moes-Sosnowska', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics and Clinical Immunology, National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Szpechcinski', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics and Clinical Immunology, National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chorostowska-Wynimko', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics and Clinical Immunology, National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Warsaw, Poland.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que están hablando en este fragmento es el cáncer de pulmón de células no pequeñas (NSCLC).

Immune escape and waning immunity of COVID-19 monovalent mRNA vaccines against symptomatic infection with BA.1/BA.2 and BA.5 in Japan.,"['Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)', 'SARS-CoV-2 variants', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)', 'Test-negative design', 'Vaccine effectiveness']",Vaccine,"Repeated emergence of variants with immune escape capacity and waning immunity from vaccination are major concerns for COVID-19. We examined whether the surge in Omicron subvariant BA.5 cases was due to immune escape or waning immunity through vaccine effectiveness (VE) evaluation.
A test-negative case-control study was conducted in 16 clinics/hospitals during the BA.1/BA.2-dominant and BA.5-dominant periods. VE against symptomatic infection was estimated after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, occupation, testing frequency, prior infection, close contact history, clinic/hospital, week, and preventive measures. Absolute VE (aVE) was calculated for 2/3/4 doses, compared to the unvaccinated. Relative VE (rVE) was calculated, comparing 3 vs 2 and 4 vs 3 doses.
13,025 individuals were tested during the BA.1/BA.2-dominant and BA.5-dominant periods with similar baseline characteristics. For BA.1/BA.2, aVE was 52 % (95 %CI:34-66) 14 days-3 months post-dose 2, 42 % (29-52) > 6 months post-dose 2, 71 % (64-77) 14 days-3 months post-dose 3, and 68 % (52-79) 3-6 months post-dose 3. rVE was 49 % (38-57) 14 days-3 months post-dose 3 and 45 % (18-63) 3-6 months post-dose 3. For BA.5, aVE was 56 % (27-73) 3-6 months post-dose 2, 32 % (12-47) > 6 months post-dose 2, 70 % (61-78) 14 days-3 months post-dose 3, 59 % (48-68) 3-6 months post-dose 3, 50 % (29-64) > 6 months post-dose 3, and 74 % (61-83) ≥ 14 days post-dose 4. rVE was 56 % (45-65) 14 days-3 months post-dose 3, 39 % (27-48) 3-6 months post-dose 3, 25 % (-2-45) > 6 months post-dose 3, and 30 % (-6-54) ≥ 14 days post-dose 4.
Booster doses initially provided high protection against BA.5 at a level similar to that against BA.1/BA.2. However, the protection seemed shorter-lasting against BA.5, which likely contributed to the surge. Furthermore, rVE post-dose 4 was low even among recent vaccinees. These results support the introduction of variant-containing vaccines and emphasize the need for vaccines with longer duration of protection.",2023-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Arashiro', 'firstname': 'Takeshi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center for Surveillance, Immunization, and Epidemiologic Research, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan; Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan; Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, United Kingdom; School of Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.

Assessment of CT perfusion indices of the clinicoradiological response to anti-tubercular therapy in patients with intestinal tuberculosis.,[],Clinical radiology,"To explore the possibility of using a novel technique, CT perfusion imaging, to monitor the response to anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) in patients with intestinal tuberculosis.
A prospective observational study was performed in adults with treatment naive-intestinal tuberculosis. Clinical, endoscopic, and conventional radiological findings of patients were compared at baseline and post-ATT. CT perfusion imaging was performed with recording of six perfusion parameters (blood flow, blood volume, mean transit time, time to peak, maximum peak intensity, and permeability/blood flow extraction).
Twenty-two patients (13 women, 59%) with a median age of 25 years were recruited. The terminal ileum and ileocaecal junction were the most frequent sites of involvement (59%), with multiple segments of the intestine being involved in 16 patients (73%). Median duration of ATT was 6 months (range 6-10 months). Complete clinical response was observed in 22/22 (100%) patients, endoscopic response in 12/12 (100%) patients, and radiological response in 10/13 (76%) patients. There was a significant decrease in mean blood flow, blood volume, maximum peak intensity, and an increase in mean transit time and time to peak on follow-up CT perfusion imaging performed after 6 months of ATT.
Significant alterations in CT perfusion parameters were demonstrated following treatment, consistent with a decline in inflammation and vascularity. CT perfusion imaging of the bowel is a novel means to assess the radiological response to ATT in intestinal tuberculosis, although at the cost of a higher dose of radiation exposure.",2023-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Sasi', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahuja', 'firstname': 'V', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'C J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiodiagnosis, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Arora', 'firstname': 'U', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Garg', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Razik', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiodiagnosis, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kedia', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology and Human Nutrition, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jadon', 'firstname': 'R Singh', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, AIIMS, Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Soneja', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, AIIMS, Delhi, India.

"Integration, effectiveness and costs of different models of primary health care provision for people who are homeless: an evaluation study.",[],Health and social care delivery research,"There is a high prevalence of health problems among single people who are homeless. Specialist primary health care services for this population have been developed in several locations across England; however, there have been very few evaluations of these services.
This study evaluated the work of different models of primary health care provision in England to determine their effectiveness in engaging people who are homeless in health care and in providing continuity of care for long-term conditions. It concerned single people (not families or couples with dependent children) staying in hostels, other temporary accommodation or on the streets. The influence on outcomes of contextual factors and mechanisms (service delivery factors), including integration with other services, were examined. Data from medical records were collated on participants' use of health care and social care services over 12 months, and costs were calculated.
The evaluation involved four existing Health Service Models: (1) health centres primarily for people who are homeless (Dedicated Centres), (2) Mobile Teams providing health care in hostels and day centres, (3) Specialist GPs providing some services exclusively for patients who are homeless and (4) Usual Care GPs providing no special services for people who are homeless (as a comparison). Two Case Study Sites were recruited for each of the specialist models, and four for the Usual Care GP model.
People who had been homeless during the previous 12 months were recruited as 'case study participants'; they were interviewed at baseline and at 4 and 8 months, and information was collected about their circumstances and their health and service use in the preceding 4 months. Overall, 363 participants were recruited; medical records were obtained for 349 participants. Interviews were conducted with 65 Case Study Site staff and sessional workers, and 81 service providers and stakeholders.
The primary outcome was the extent of health screening for body mass index, mental health, alcohol use, tuberculosis, smoking and hepatitis A among participants, and evidence of an intervention if a problem was identified. There were no overall differences in screening between the models apart from Mobile Teams, which scored considerably lower. Dedicated Centres and Specialist GPs were more successful in providing continuity of care for participants with depression and alcohol and drug problems. Service use and costs were significantly higher for Dedicated Centre participants and lower for Usual Care GP participants. Participants and staff welcomed flexible and tailored approaches to care, and related services being available in the same building. Across all models, dental needs were unaddressed and staff reported poor availability of mental health services.
There were difficulties recruiting mainstream general practices for the Usual Care GP model. Medical records could not be accessed for 14 participants of this model.
Participant characteristics, contextual factors and mechanisms were influential in determining outcomes. Overall, outcomes for Dedicated Centres and for one of the Specialist GP sites were relatively favourable. They had dedicated staff for patients who were homeless, 'drop-in' services, on-site mental health and substance misuse services, and worked closely with hospitals and homelessness sector services.

Health problems are common among single people who are homeless, but there is little evidence of the best ways to deliver primary health care to them. This study evaluated four types of services (models) that are in existence: (1) health centres primarily for people who are homeless (Dedicated Centres); (2) Mobile Teams that provide health care in hostels and day centres; (3) Specialist GPs that have some services exclusively for patients who are homeless; and (4) Usual Care GPs providing health care to all patients, with no special services for people who are homeless. The study concentrated on single people (not homeless families or couples with dependent children) staying in hostels, other temporary accommodation and on the streets. Overall, 363 patients at these practices who had been homeless in the previous 12 months participated, and information was collected from them over a 12-month period. We examined the extent to which screening for different health conditions was undertaken, and to which treatment and follow-up care were provided for participants with chronic respiratory problems, depression, alcohol problems and drug problems. Information was gathered from their medical records about use of health and social care services over 12 months. Overall, outcomes for Dedicated Centres and for one of the Specialist GP sites were more favourable. They had staff working specifically with patients who were homeless; provided flexible ‘drop-in’ services instead of requiring patients to book appointments; and worked closely with mental health, alcohol and drug services, and with hostels, day centres and street outreach teams. Participants were also more satisfied with the health care they received from the specialist models, and were more likely to say that they had confidence and trust in doctors and nurses at these sites.

Optimizing the use of current antituberculosis drugs to overcome drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"['BVL-GSK098', 'MDR', 'Tuberculosis', 'XDR', 'high-dose']",Infectious diseases now,"Antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis continues to be one of the major threats to global tuberculosis control. After a hiatus of over 40 years in antituberculosis drug development, the last decade has seen a resurgence of research, yielding a number of promising compounds in the tuberculosis drug pipeline, with some that are now game changers in the treatment of MDRTB. Despite this progress, there are still obstacles restricting the use of these molecules as first-line drugs. The quick appearance of bacteria resistant to these new treatments highlights a continuing need to fuel the discovery and development of new molecules. With this in mind, alternative strategies aimed at optimizing the utilization of existing antituberculosis agents are currently under evaluation. They are focused on enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics against their bacterial targets, primarily by augmenting the quantity of antibiotic that engages with these targets. This objective can be achieved through two primary approaches: 1) Provided that toxicity concerns are not a limiting factor, increased dosing is a viable avenue, as demonstrated by rifampicin, isoniazid, and fluoroquinolones, for which escalated dosing has been effective; and 2) Employing enhancers such as drug activator boosters (ethionamide), efflux pump inhibitors, or hydrolytic enzyme inhibitors (kanamycin) can elevate the concentration of antibiotics in bacterial cells.

Therefore, the recognition of potential host microRNAs can be valuable for the diagnosis of TB. The field of miRNA biomarkers in TB requires more extensive research to identify potential biomarkers. This review provides an overview of the biogenesis and biological functions of microRNAs and presents the findings of various studies on the identification of potential biomarkers for TB.

Risk factors for poor engagement with a smart pillbox adherence intervention among persons on tuberculosis treatment in Ethiopia.,"['Digital adherence technologies', 'Drug-sensitive tuberculosis', 'Ethiopia', 'Poor engagement', 'Smart pillbox']",BMC public health,"Non-adherence to tuberculosis treatment increases the risk of poor treatment outcomes. Digital adherence technologies (DATs), including the smart pillbox (EvriMED), aim to improve treatment adherence and are being widely evaluated. As part of the Adherence Support Coalition to End TB (ASCENT) project we analysed data from a cluster-randomised trial of DATs and differentiated care in Ethiopia to examine individual-factors for poor engagement with the smart pillbox.
Data were obtained from a cohort of trial participants with drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) whose treatment started between 1 December 2020 and 1 May 2022, and who were using the smart pillbox. Poor engagement with the pillbox was defined as (i) > 20% days with no digital confirmation and (ii) the count of days with no digital confirmation, and calculated over a two evaluation periods (56-days and 168-days). Logistic random effects regression was used to model > 20% days with no digital confirmation and negative binomial random effects regression to model counts of days with no digital confirmation, both accounting for clustering of individuals at the facility-level.
Among 1262 participants, 10.8% (133/1262) over 56-days and 15.8% (200/1262) over 168-days had > 20% days with no digital confirmation. The odds of poor engagement was less among participants in the higher stratum of socio-economic position (SEP) over 56-days. Overall, 4,689/67,315 expected doses over 56-days and 18,042/199,133 expected doses over 168-days were not digitally confirmed.

Halomonas spp., especially Halomonas bluephagenesis, have been engineered to produce various biopolyesters such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), some proteins, small molecular compounds, organic acids, and has the potential to become a chassis cell for the next-generation of industrial biotechnology (NGIB) owing to its simple culture, fast growth, contamination-resistant, low production cost, and high production value. An efficient genome editing system is the key for its engineering and application. However, the efficiency of the established CRISPR-Cas-homologous recombination (HR) gene editing tool for large DNA fragments was still relatively low. In this study, we firstly report a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system combined with a non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair system for efficient large DNA fragment deletion in Halomonas bluephagenesis.
Three different NHEJ repair systems were selected and functionally identified in Halomonas bluephagenesis TD01. The NHEJ system from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Mt-NHEJ) can functionally work in H. bluephagenesis TD01, resulting in base deletion of different lengths for different genes and some random base insertions. Factors affecting knockout efficiencies, such as the number and position of sgRNAs on the DNA double-strands, the Cas9 protein promoter, and the interaction between the HR and the NHEJ repair system, were further investigated. Finally, the optimized CRISPR-Cas9-NHEJ editing system was able to delete DNA fragments up to 50 kb rapidly with high efficiency of 31.3%, when three sgRNAs on the Crick/Watson/Watson DNA double-strands and the arabinose-induced promoter P

Thus, the main purposes of this study were first to investigate thoroughly the relation between the carrier-proteins level and the drug binding and second to investigate the feasibility of predicting the free drug concentrations by the means of in vitro and in vivo results. In vitro experiments mimicked real-case samples by spiking drugs combinations from the clinical practice. We measured a median in vivo protein binding of 1.5% for ethambutol, 9.7% for isoniazid, 0.7% for pyrazinamide and 88.2% for rifampicin; and a median in vitro protein binding of 26.2% for levofloxacin, 12.8% for linezolid and 46.3% for moxifloxacin. The albumin concentration had a moderate impact on the moxifloxacin binding and a strong impact on the levofloxacin, linezolid and rifampicin binding (below values of 30 g/L). The determination of the free drug concentration seems to have few interests for ethambutol, isoniazid, moxifloxacin and pyrazinamide, a limited interest for linezolid because of its low binding and a major interest for rifampicin in hypoalbuminemia TB patients and for levofloxacin because their total concentration was an inaccurate reflection of the free concentration. The free concentration predicted by mathematical model was suitable for levofloxacin and linezolid, unlike for rifampicin, where the real free concentration should be measured. Further investigations should be carried out to investigate the benefit of the free concentration for levofloxacin, linezolid and rifampicin mainly in the critical period of active tuberculosis associated to hypoalbuminemia.",2023-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Fage', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Laboratoire Hospitalier Universitaire de Bruxelles - Universitair Laboratorium Brussel (LHUB-ULB), Brussels, Belgium.

Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous and dynamic condition, and SAPH pathogenesis is believed to be multifactorial. The main roles in SAPH development play: parenchymal lung disease with the destruction of pulmonary vessels, the extrinsic compression of pulmonary vessels by conglomerate masses, lymphadenopathy or fibrosing mediastinitis, pulmonary vasculopathy, LV dysfunction, and portal hypertension. Recently, it has been recommended to individually tailor SAPH management according to the predominant pathomechanism, i.e., SAPH phenotype. Unfortunately, SAPH phenotyping is not a straightforward process. First, there are gaps in our understanding of undergoing processes. Second, the assessment of such a pivotal element as pulmonary vasculature on a microscopic level is non-feasible in SAPH patients antemortem.

The Impact of COVID-19 on Cellular Factors Influencing Red Blood Cell Aggregation Examined in Dextran: Possible Causes and Consequences.,"['COVID-19', 'blood rheology', 'pneumonia', 'porosity of aggregates', 'red blood cells aggregation']",International journal of molecular sciences,"Several studies have indicated that COVID-19 can lead to alterations in blood rheology, including an increase in red blood cell aggregation. The precise mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not yet fully comprehended. The latest findings suggest that erythrocyte aggregation significantly influences microcirculation, causes the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, and even damages the endothelial glycocalyx, leading to endothelial dysfunction. The focus of this research lies in investigating the cellular factors influencing these changes in aggregation and discussing potential causes and implications in the context of COVID-19 pathophysiology. For this purpose, the aggregation of erythrocytes in a group of 52 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was examined in a 70 kDa Dextran solution, which eliminates the influence of plasma factors. Using image analysis, the velocities and sizes of the formed aggregates were investigated, determining their porosity. This study showed that the process of erythrocyte aggregation in COVID-19 patients, independent of plasma factors, leads to the formation of more compact, denser, three-dimensional aggregates. These aggregates may be less likely to disperse under circulatory shear stress, increasing the risk of thrombotic events. This study also suggests that cellular aggregation factors can be responsible for the thrombotic disorders observed long after infection, even when plasma factors have normalized. The results and subsequent broad discussion presented in this study can contribute to a better understanding of the potential complications associated with increased erythrocyte aggregation.",2023-10-14,"[{'lastname': 'Bosek', 'firstname': 'Maciej', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wybranowski', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Napiórkowska-Mastalerz', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pyskir', 'firstname': 'Jerzy', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Cyrankiewicz', 'firstname': 'Michał', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pyskir', 'firstname': 'Małgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rehabilitation, Faculty of Health Sciences, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pilaczyńska-Cemel', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Lung Diseases, Neoplasms and Tuberculosis, Faculty of Medicine, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Szołna-Chodór', 'firstname': 'Alicja', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wrembel', 'firstname': 'Mateusz', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Lung Diseases, Neoplasms and Tuberculosis, Faculty of Medicine, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kruszewski', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Przybylski', 'firstname': 'Grzegorz', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Lung Diseases, Neoplasms and Tuberculosis, Faculty of Medicine, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, 85-067 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}]",COVID-19.

"Time-Resolved Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Blood, Plasma and Albumin as a Potential Diagnostic Tool for Acute Inflammation in COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients.","['COVID-19', 'fluorescence lifetime of blood', 'fluorescence lifetime of plasma', 'human albumin serum', 'oxidative stress in COVID-19', 'time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of blood']",International journal of molecular sciences,"Fluorescence lifetime measurements of blood or plasma offer valuable insights into the microenvironment and molecular interactions of fluorophores, particularly concerning albumin. Neutrophil- and hypoxia-induced oxidative stress in COVID-19 pneumonia patients leads to hyperinflammation, various oxidative modifications of blood proteins, and potential alterations in the fluorescence lifetime of tryptophan-containing proteins, especially albumin. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of blood and plasma as a prompt diagnostic tool for the early diagnosis and severity assessment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia. This study examined a cohort of sixty COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms. To investigate whether oxidative stress is the underlying cause of the change in fluorescence lifetime, human serum albumin was treated with chloramine T. The time-resolved spectrometer Life Spec II (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd., Livingston, UK), equipped with a sub-nanosecond pulsed 280 nm diode, was used to measure the fluorescence lifetime of blood and plasma. The findings revealed a significant reduction in the fluorescence lifetime of blood (diluted 200 times) and plasma (diluted 20 times) at 360 nm in COVID-19 pneumonia patients compared with their respective values recorded six months post-infection and those of healthy individuals. Significant negative correlations were observed between the mean fluorescence lifetime of blood and plasma at 360 nm and several severity biomarkers and advanced oxidation protein products, while a positive correlation was found with albumin and the albumin-globulin ratio. The time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy method demonstrates the potential to be used as a preliminary screening technique for identifying patients who are at risk of developing severe complications.

Perspectives on pregnant women's educational needs to prevent TB complications during pregnancy and the neonatal period. A qualitative study.,"['HIV co-infection', 'Maternal morbidity', 'Pregnant women', 'Tuberculosis']",BMC public health,"Tuberculosis (TB) during pregnancy could confer a high risk for maternal and infant morbidity. Literature indicates that the global burden of active TB disease among pregnant women is not well researched. Statistics for South Africa from WHO give an estimated incidence of 360, 000 cases of TB in 2019; 14,000 people became ill with multidrug-resistant TB in 2019, with a rate of 615 per 100,000 population, implying that the cohorts included pregnant women with and without a diagnosis of TB infection. Therefore, the study aims to increase the understanding of the educational needs required to prevent TB complications during pregnancy and the neonatal period in women diagnosed with TB infection.
The study used cross-sectional qualitative and descriptive designs to collect data in the clinical setting of the primary health care services of Limpopo Province, South Africa. The population comprised pregnant women diagnosed with TB infection. A non-probability purposive sampling technique was used to sample 2 health centers and 5 clinics in each of the three sampled districts. The targeted sample size was 63 and it was achieved even though data saturation was observed. Individual interviews were conducted, audiotaped, and transcribed. Guided by the study questions, a thematic content analysis of the findings was used. Ethical considerations were also observed.
Despite that pregnant women have general knowledge about TB disease, the knowledge and awareness regarding the prevention of TB complications in pregnancy and the neonatal period, information on TB/HIV and COVID-19 co-infections, and participants' knowledge about other non-infectious diseases that may affect the mother with TB infection and foetus showed a deficit.
Pregnant women with TB disease need to be educated on the negative effects of non-adherence to TB treatment during pregnancy and the neonatal period. There is a need to educate pregnant women about the variant signs and symptoms of TB, HIV and COVID-19 infections since there is a misconception that the three diseases are similar.

Asiaticoside A for the modulation of 1-TbAd- a potential target and ligand for extensive drug resistance Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,"['Asiaticoside A', 'Extensively drug-resistant', 'Molecular dynamic simulation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'mRNA expression']",AMB Express,"In nature, terpene nucleosides are relatively rare, with 1-tuberculosinyladenosine (1-TbAd) being an exclusive feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The convergence of nucleosides and terpene pathways in the Mtb complex appears to have emerged late in its evolutionary history. 1-TbAd (PDB ID: 3WQK) is a prominent chemical marker for Mtb and may contribute to its virulence-related properties when exported extracellularly. We gathered a comprehensive set of 270 phytochemicals from diverse Ayurvedic texts and treatment traditions. Subsequently, we conducted structure-based molecular docking analyses to identify compounds exhibiting the strongest binding affinity for 1-TbAd, highlighting their potential as drug candidates. These selected compounds were further subjected to an in-vitro growth inhibition assay against the reference strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv. Among the candidates, Asiaticoside A (ASA) emerged as a promising candidate from the pool of 270 compounds. To assess the impact of ASA on 1-TbAd expression, we employed a PCR-based mRNA expression assay, revealing ASA's ability to downregulate 1-TbAd expression in extensively drug-resistant MTb strains. Remarkably, the conventional drug rifampin showed no such effectiveness in our experiments. We further conducted molecular dynamic simulations to explore the interaction between ASA and 1-TbAd in a cellular-like environment, confirming the stability of their interaction. Also, we predicted ASA's stability toward causing inducing the random mutations in the target gene.

Parallel signatures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human Y-chromosome phylogeography support the Two Layer model of East Asian population history.,[],Communications biology,"The Two Layer hypothesis is fast becoming the favoured narrative describing East Asian population history. Under this model, hunter-gatherer groups who initially peopled East Asia via a route south of the Himalayas were assimilated by agriculturalist migrants who arrived via a northern route across Eurasia. A lack of ancient samples from tropical East Asia limits the resolution of this model. We consider insight afforded by patterns of variation within the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by analysing its phylogeographic signatures jointly with the human Y-chromosome. We demonstrate the Y-chromosome lineages enriched in the traditionally hunter-gatherer groups associated with East Asia's first layer of peopling to display deep roots, low long-term effective population size, and diversity patterns consistent with a southern entry route. These characteristics mirror those of the evolutionarily ancient Mtb lineage 1. The remaining East Asian Y-chromosome lineage is almost entirely absent from traditionally hunter-gatherer groups and displays spatial and temporal characteristics which are incompatible with a southern entry route, and which link it to the development of agriculture in modern-day China. These characteristics mirror those of the evolutionarily modern Mtb lineage 2.

Here, we report a 2.7 Å structure of a mycobacterial Rv1410 homologue, which adopts an outward-facing conformation and exhibits unusual transmembrane helix 11 and 12 extensions that protrude ~20 Å into the periplasm. A small, very hydrophobic cavity suitable for lipid transport is constricted by a functionally important ion-lock likely involved in proton coupling.

[Tuberculosis Infection Control & Hygiene - Recommendations of the DZK].,[],"Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)","Preventing the spread of the disease is an essential goal in the care and treatment of tuberculosis. In addition to early diagnosis and effective therapies, isolation of infectious patients and adequate hygiene measures are of particular importance for infection prevention. The present recommendations replace the previous recommendations ""tuberculosis infection control"" from 2012 and take into account the current national and international recommendations and as well as new scientific findings. After a description of the infection and the transmission pathways, the necessary prevention and hygiene measures in health care facilities are comprehensively presented. Since the last revision of the recommendations on infection prevention, international recommendations and the KRINKO recommendation on ending isolation have been changed. In accordance with this, under certain conditions in the case of sensitive tuberculosis, de-isolation in health care facilities can take place after 14 days without taking the sputum findings into account. The second part of the recommendations explains in detail the measures to be taken in special situations and areas, such as general practitioners, ambulance services and care facilities. Here, the recommendations on respiratory protection have been simplified; for staff, an FFP2 mask is now generally considered sufficient.
Die Vermeidung der Weiterverbreitung der Erkrankung ist ein wesentliches Ziel in der Betreuung und Behandlung von Tuberkulose. Für die Infektionsprävention von besonderer Bedeutung sind neben der frühzeitigen Diagnose und effektiven Therapien eine Isolierung ansteckungsfähiger Patientinnen und Patienten und adäquate Hygienemaßnahmen. Die vorliegenden Empfehlungen ersetzen die bisherigen Empfehlungen „Infektionsprävention bei Tuberkulose“ aus dem Jahre 2012 und berücksichtigen die aktuellen nationalen und internationalen Empfehlungen und neue wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnisse. Nach einer Beschreibung der Infektion und der Übertragungswege werden die notwendigen Präventions- und Hygienemaßnahmen in Gesundheitseinrichtungen umfangreich dargestellt. Seit der letzten Überarbeitung der Empfehlungen zur Infektionsprävention wurden internationale Empfehlungen und die KRINKO-Empfehlung zur Beendigung der Isolierung geändert. In Übereinstimmung hiermit kann unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen bei sensibler Tuberkulose eine Entisolierung in Gesundheitseinrichtungen nach 14 Tagen ohne Berücksichtigung der Sputumbefunde erfolgen. Im zweiten Teil der Empfehlungen werden ausführlich die Maßnahmen in speziellen Situationen und Bereichen, wie Arztpraxen, Krankentransport und Pflegeeinrichtungen, erläutert.

Effect of seven anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens on sputum microbiome: a retrospective analysis of the HIGHRIF study 2 and PanACEA MAMS-TB clinical trials.,[],The Lancet. Microbe,"Respiratory tract microbiota has been described as the gatekeeper for respiratory health. We aimed to assess the impact of standard-of-care and experimental anti-tuberculosis treatment regimens on the respiratory microbiome and implications for treatment outcomes.
In this retrospective study, we analysed the sputum microbiome of participants with tuberculosis treated with six experimental regimens versus standard-of-care who were part of the HIGHRIF study 2 (NCT00760149) and PanACEA MAMS-TB (NCT01785186) clinical trials across a 3-month treatment follow-up period. Samples were from participants in Mbeya, Kilimanjaro, Bagamoyo, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Experimental regimens were composed of different combinations of rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), pyrazinamide (Z), ethambutol (E), moxifloxacin (M), and a new drug, SQ109 (Q). Reverse transcription was used to create complementary DNA for each participant's total sputum RNA and the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced using the Illumina metagenomic technique. Qiime was used to analyse the amplicon sequence variants and estimate alpha diversity. Descriptive statistics were applied to assess differences in alpha diversity pre-treatment and post-treatment initiation and the effect of each treatment regimen.
Sequence data were obtained from 397 pre-treatment and post-treatment samples taken between Sept 26, 2008, and June 30, 2015, across seven treatment regimens. Pre-treatment microbiome (206 genera) was dominated by Firmicutes (2860 [44%] of 6500 amplicon sequence variants [ASVs]) at the phylum level and Streptococcus (2340 [36%] ASVs) at the genus level. Two regimens had a significant depressing effect on the microbiome after 2 weeks of treatment, HR

However, the mechanism underlying the regulation of STING exit from the ER remains elusive. Here, we found that STING induces the activation of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) prior to STING trafficking in a TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1)-dependent manner. Intriguingly, activated TAK1 directly mediates STING phosphorylation on serine 355, which facilitates its interaction with STING ER exit protein (STEEP) and thereby promotes its oligomerization and translocation to the ERGIC for subsequent activation. Importantly, activation of TAK1 by monophosphoryl lipid A, a TLR4 agonist, boosts cGAMP-induced antitumor immunity dependent on STING phosphorylation in a mouse allograft tumor model. Taken together, TAK1 was identified as a checkpoint for STING activation by promoting its trafficking, providing a basis for combinatory tumor immunotherapy and intervention in STING-related diseases.",2023-10-14,"[{'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Mingtong', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine; Shanghai 200433, China; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dang', 'firstname': 'Yifang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China; Central Laboratory, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine; Shanghai 200433, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Boran', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Andrology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Fei', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Tuberculosis, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine; Shanghai 200433, China; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Junfang', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Translation Research Center, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine; Shanghai 200433, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Central Laboratory, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine; Shanghai 200433, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Hang', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine; Shanghai 200433, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Jinsong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Molecular Andrology, CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.

We conducted a systematic review on treatment regimen and duration pre- and directly post-LTx, for patients with known NTM-PD pre-LTx. Additionally, we searched for risk factors for NTM disease development post-LTx and for mortality.
Literature was reviewed on PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library, for articles published from inception to January 2022. Individual patient data were sought.
Sixteen studies were included reporting 92 patients. Most frequent used agents were aminoglycosides and macrolides for Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus) and macrolides and tuberculostatic agents for Mycobacterium avium complex (M. avium complex). The median treatment duration pre-LTx was 10 months (IQR 6-17) and 2 months (IQR 2-8) directly post-LTx. Longer treatment duration pre-LTx was observed in children and in patients with M. abscessus. 46% of the patients with NTM-PD pre-LTx developed NTM disease post-LTx, related mortality rate was 10%. Longer treatment duration pre-LTx (p < 0.001) and sputum non-conversion pre-LTx (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with development of NTM-disease post-LTx. Longer treatment duration pre-LTx (p = 0.004), younger age (p < 0.001) and sputum non-conversion (p = 0.044) were risk factors for NTM related death.

The altered intestinal microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of TB, but the exact links remain unclear.
16 S rDNA sequencing was performed to comprehensively detect the changes in the intestinal microbiota of feces from active TB (ATB), latent TB infection (LTBI) and healthy controls (HC).
The rarefaction curves demonstrated the sequencing results' validity. The alpha diversity was lowest in ATB, while highest in HC. Boxplot of beta diversity showed significant differences in every two groups. LDA Effect Size (LEfSe) Analysis revealed differences in probiotic bacteria like Romboutsia, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in LTBI, and pro-inflammatory bacteria like R. gnavus, Streptococcus and Erysipelatoclostridium in ATB, corresponding to the cluster analysis. PICRUST2 analysis revealed the pentose phosphate pathway was active in ATB and LTBI (more active in ATB). The differences between the groups are statistically significant at the P<0.05 level.
Our study indicated that from LTBI to ATB, some intestinal microbiota inhibit the synthesis of interferon (INF)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17, promoting the survival and spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb).

A case report of primary biliary cholangitis combined with ankylosing spondylitis.,[],Medicine,"A chronic autoimmune liver disease known as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) that selectively destructs small intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells and may result in biliary cirrhosis and eventually liver transplantation or death. PBC is associated with various other extrahepatic autoimmune diseases; however, the combination of PBC with ankylosing spondylitis has been rarely reported in the literature. Here, we reported a case of PBC with ankylosing spondylitis to improve our understanding of such coexistence and provide new ideas for the treatment of such patients.
A 54-year-old man was presented to the Department of Rheumatology because of an abnormal liver function test for 7 years, chest and back pain for 1 year, and low back pain for 2 months.
Primary biliary cholangitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and old pulmonary tuberculosis.
The patient refused to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; thus, he was treated with methylenediphosphonate (99Tc-MDP) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
The patient achieved remission with UDCA and 99Tc-MDP therapy.
In the treatment of PBC combined with other disorders, the characteristics of different diseases should be considered. The patient reported herein was treated with 99Tc-MDP and UDCA, and his condition improved; thus, we consider 99Tc-MDP to be an effective treatment. Furthermore, in line with the current understanding of the pathogenesis of PBC and ankylosing spondylitis, we hypothesize that interleukin-17 inhibitor is an effective treatment for such patients.",2023-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Chunfeng', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Rheumatology, Jining No.1 People's Hospital, Jining, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Ren', 'firstname': 'Chunfeng', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Luan', 'firstname': 'Luan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Shujie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}]",La enfermedad sobre la que están hablando es la Colangitis Biliar Primaria (PBC) junto con la Espondilitis Anquilosante.
"Tuberculosis presentation and outcomes in older Hispanic adults from Tamaulipas, Mexico.",[],Medicine,"Older people are at high risk of developing and dying from pulmonary infections like tuberculosis (TB), but there are few studies among them, particularly in Hispanics. To address these gaps, we sought to identify host factors associated with TB and adverse treatment outcomes in older Hispanics by conducting a cross-sectional study of TB surveillance data from Tamaulipas, Mexico (2006-2013; n = 8381). Multivariable logistic regressions were assessed for older adults (OA ≥65 years) when compared to young (YA, 18-39 years) and middle-aged adults (40-64 years). We found that the OA had features associated with a less complicated TB (e.g., lower prevalence of extra-pulmonary TB and less likely to abandon treatment or have drug resistant TB), and yet, were more likely to die during TB treatment (adj-OR 3.9, 95% 2.5, 5.25). Among the OA, excess alcohol use and low body mass index increased their odds of death during TB treatment, while a higher number of reported contacts (social support) was protective. Diabetes was not associated with adverse outcomes in OA. Although older age is a predictor of death during TB disease, OA are not prioritized by the World Health Organization for latent TB infection screening and treatment during contact investigations. With safer, short-course latent TB infection treatment available, we propose the inclusion of OA as a high-risk group in latent TB management guidelines.",2023-10-13,"[{'lastname': 'Medrano', 'firstname': 'Belinda A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Brownsville campus, Brownsville, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Miryoung', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Brownsville campus, Brownsville, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gemeinhardt', 'firstname': 'Gretchen', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Management, Policy and Community Health, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Herrera', 'firstname': 'Javier E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Secretaría de Salud de Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas, México, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'García-Viveros', 'firstname': 'Moncerrato', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Secretaría de Salud de Tamaulipas, Tamaulipas, México, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Restrepo', 'firstname': 'Blanca I', 'initials': 'BI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetics and Environmental Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Brownsville campus, Brownsville, TX, USA.\nPopulation Health Program, Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, USA.\nSchool of Medicine, South Texas Diabetes and Obesity Institute, University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX, USA.'}]",La enfermedad sobre la que están hablando es: tuberculosis (TB)
A case report of systemic lupus erythematosus and intestinal tuberculosis with lower gastrointestinal bleeding: A treatment approach utilizing parenteral nutrition.,[],Medicine,"Limited literatures are available on lower gastrointestinal bleeding in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) combined with intestinal tuberculosis. Sharing the treatment experiences of a 26-year-old female patient diagnosed with this complex condition in this report may contribute valuable insights.
The patient initially presented with abdominal pain and active gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to admission to the hospital. Over a 2-week period, she experienced persistent bleeding, with daily volumes ranging from 300 mL to 800 mL.
Lower gastrointestinal bleeding was diagnosed in this patient with concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus and intestinal tuberculosis.
As her symptoms rapidly progressed, food and water intake had to be completely restricted. The parenteral nutrition was implemented.
The medical team effectively controlled the bleeding, leading to a notable improvement in the patient's condition. Consequently, she was able to resume oral intake and was discharged from the hospital.
This case highlights the significance of using parenteral nutrition in the management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus and intestinal tuberculosis.
